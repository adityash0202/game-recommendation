The player character (known as fiveEight, as revealed in kuso) runs through several linear levels. They possess three abilities: jumping, moving left and right, and leaving a checkpoint behind at the push of a button. The player has 100 lives to play through 20 levels, in which the goal is to reach the end point in each to progress to the next.[1]\n","\n","Love+ nearly completely revamped the original game. It added three new game modes: \"Easy Mode\", which gives the player unlimited lives, \"YOLO Mode\", in which the player has only one life, and \"Speedrun Mode\", in which the goal is to finish the game in the shortest possible time. The original mode was renamed to \"Arcade Mode\". Many of the levels in the original game were scrapped, being replaced by completely new levels, and those that were carried over were heavily altered. Overall, Love+ has fewer levels in its main campaign than Love, with Love having twenty and Love+ having sixteen.\n","\n","In updates, five more levels were added to Love+'s original line-up of eleven. Additionally, a fifth game mode titled \"Remix Mode\" was added in an update, which has the player play through seven \"remixes\" of levels from the main game,[6] and later, in another update, a \"bonus level\" based on World 1-1 from Super Mario Bros. was added.[7]\n","\n","Plot[edit]\n","\n","fiveEight wakes up in a strange mechanical world, where everything they once knew has been replaced by machinery. They have no memory of what happened, except that things were much better before they woke up. They have nothing pushing them forward except a feeling in the back of their mind, telling them that there is a light at the end of the tunnel, with nothing but the hope of getting to something better.[8]\n","\n","\n","Gameplay[edit]\n","\n","The game can be played alone or with two to four players. The players pilot a spaceship with a variety of stations located inside it. These stations control the ship's weapons, engine, shield, Yamato cannon, and map. Each player controls only a single avatar (as well as commanding the AI pet in single-player mode), and thus must constantly move from station to station in order to balance flying the ship, protecting it from damage, and attacking enemies. During the course of gameplay, gift boxes can be discovered which may contain gems. These gems can be attached to the stations, giving them new, enhanced powers.\n","\n","The game consists of four campaigns; each contains four levels and a boss fight. The goal of the regular levels is to find and rescue an assortment of captured creatures including bunnies, frogs, foxes, and ducks. After capturing five such creatures in a level, a heart-shaped portal to the next level is unlocked and the players may enter it to complete the level. A few levels feature an alternative gameplay mode in which a special engine is attached to the ship which the players must protect as it warps the ship to a new area. Up to ten creatures may be rescued per level. Creatures saved count towards improving the effectiveness of the ship by allowing two gems per station or unlocking new ship layouts.\n","\n","\n","Gameplay[edit]\n","\n","Luigi's Mansion 3 is an action-adventure game, in which players control the character of Luigi from a fixed third-person perspective, as they capture ghosts across a large hotel setting.[1] The game features two modes of gameplay – a single-player story mode, and a set of multiplayer game modes – in which ghost catching functions in the same manner as previous installments: players stun ghosts with Luigi's Strobulb, snag them with his Poltergust, and weaken their health down to 0 in order to capture them.\n","\n","Plot[edit]\n","\n","Luigi, his pet ghost dog Polterpup, his brother Mario, Princess Peach and a trio of Toads have been invited to The Last Resort, a luxurious art deco high-rise hotel nestled in a mountainside area, and decide to visit it for a vacation. After arriving and settling in, Luigi wakes up during the night to find the hotel deserted, transformed into a haunted building and the others missing. He discovers that the hotel's ghostly owner, Hellen Gravely, had lured the group to the hotel as part of a trap by King Boo, whom she had freed from Professor E. Gadd's custody after his recapture in the previous game. King Boo announces his plans to exact revenge on Luigi and his friends by imprisoning them in portraits, but Luigi manages to escape to the hotel's basement through a laundry chute. With the help of Polterpup, who also avoided capture, Luigi explores the basement and comes across an old red car in the underground garage carrying a new Poltergust vacuum model. Using it, Luigi follows Polterpup to the lobby and finds that E. Gadd was also captured.\n","\n","Searching the lobby, Luigi comes across the professor's Dark-Light Device in a safe and uses it to free him. Setting up a portable lab in the garage, E. Gadd explains how he was also tricked into visiting the hotel and captured by Hellen, who had stolen his latest ghost collection from him to staff the building. Believing that Luigi's friends are likely trapped on the upper floors, E. Gadd recommends that Luigi finds the elevator buttons for the upper floors that had been taken from the main elevator after he secures two from a ghost he had defeated earlier. While exploring the floors, each featuring a different theme to them, Luigi is aided further by E. Gadd with two new gadgets: the Virtual Boo, a communication device based on the Virtual Boy, and Gooigi, an ectoplasmic doppelgänger of Luigi. Left with no choice, Luigi begins his search for the missing elevator buttons in order to visit each of the hotel's many floors.\n","\n","As Luigi makes his search, he comes across and defeats a variety of different ghosts while reclaiming the elevator buttons and rescuing the Toads from their portraits, much to Hellen's anger and frustration. After rescuing the Toads, he reaches the top floor where he confronts Hellen, who he manages to defeat before rescuing Mario. Luigi then follows him to the hotel's roof where they find Peach's portrait. Upon freeing her, the group is confronted by King Boo, having lost faith in Hellen and the ghosts earlier and prepares to imprison them, E. Gadd, and the Toads in a single giant portrait. After being inadvertently saved by Polterpup at the last second, Luigi finds himself forced to defeat King Boo once again, while aided by Gooigi. During the battle, King Boo enlarges the portrait's frame in an attempt to pull in the whole hotel with Luigi still on the roof. Luigi defeats King Boo and manages to recover the portrait moments before the hotel collapses into a ruined mess. After freeing his friends from the portrait, the ghosts Luigi had captured escape from their imprisonment and attempt to attack, but they become social when the jewel from King Boo's crown vanishes, implying that they were all brainwashed. E. Gadd, seeing the ghosts upset over their home's accidental destruction, elects for the group to build a new hotel, while the recaptured King Boo is returned to his custody along with Hellen. Depending on how much money Luigi collected throughout his adventure, the new hotel (built in E. Gadd's version) will be different in size. After the grand reopening, Luigi and his friends depart for home.\n","\n","\n","Gameplay[edit]\n","\n","Lumines: Puzzle Fusion is a falling block puzzle game.[2][3] The objective is to arrange grouped blocks descending from the top of a 16×10 grid playing field to create single-color squares once they have landed.[4] Grouped blocks have a 2×2 shape and vary between two colors.[2] Players can rotate the descending grouped blocks, move them left or right, or drop them straight down.[2][3] When part of the grouped blocks hits an obstruction, the remaining blocks separate from the rest and continue to fall.[5] A single-color square is created when grouped blocks form a 2×2 shape of matching color. Additional blocks of matching color can be used to create larger shapes.[5] The game ends when the blocks pile up to the top of the playing field.[3][4]\n","\n","A vertical line known as the \"time line\" sweeps through the playing field from left to right, erasing any completed single-color groups of blocks it touches and awarding points for each group.[4][5] If a square is created in the middle of the moving time line, only half of the square is taken and no points are awarded.[3] Players earn increasing score multipliers by repeatedly clearing squares on consecutive time line sweeps.[4] Additional score bonuses are earned by clearing the playing field or reducing the remaining blocks to a single color.[5] The maximum score is 999,999 points.[6] Blocks with embedded gems are known as \"special blocks\"; if these are used to create squares, they allow the time line to eliminate adjacent blocks of the same color.[4] Each stage has a skin that affects the background's appearance, the blocks' color scheme, the music track, sound effects, and the speed of the time line.[5] Stages with fast tempos make it more difficult to create large combos and stages with slow tempos may cause the playing field to fill more quickly while players wait for the time line to sweep across the screen.[3]\n","\n","There are five modes: Challenge, Single Skin, Time Attack, Puzzle, and Versus. Challenge mode is the main mode and cycles through skins in a fixed order of increasing difficulty.[5][3][7] Single Skin mode allows players to select one skin to play for the entire session.[8] In Time Attack mode, players have a limited time to clear as many blocks as possible.[9] Puzzle mode challenges players to arrange blocks to create pictures.[3] In Versus mode, players battle against A.I. opponents or against other players via their wireless connections. The Versus mode begins with the playing field divided in half; the goal is to clear successive squares, which shrinks the opposing player's space.[5][10]\n","\n","Later ports and remasters added modes such as Arcade,[11] Mission,[12] Shuffle,[11] and Skin Edit mode.[12] Arcade mode is designed for mobile phone ports; players complete a total of 20 stages with CPU versus battles serving as Boss stages after a certain amount of stages are complete.[11][13] Arcade mode also adds blocks that can explode, a third color block within certain stages, and new grouped block shapes such as S-shaped or three-block-wide rectangles.[13] Mission mode offers a range of challenges such as clearing the stage in a certain number of moves or clearing a specified number of columns.[12][14] Shuffle mode creates game sessions with a randomized order of stages.[13] Skin Edit mode allows players to customize their game session by selecting the order of unlocked skins.[12][14]\n","\n","\n","Gameplay[edit]\n","\n","In Lumo, the player completes a series of puzzles in over 400 rooms to complete the game.[4] The game places a heavy emphasis on exploration and discovering secrets and contains multiple hidden challenges and minigames.[5]\n","\n","\n","Gameplay[edit]\n","\n","The goal of Machinarium is to solve a series of puzzles and brain teasers. The puzzles are linked together by an overworld consisting of a traditional \"point and click\" adventure story. The overworld's most radical departure is that only objects within the player character's reach can be clicked on.\n","\n","Machinarium is notable in that it contains no dialogue, spoken or written, and apart from a few tutorial prompts on the first screen, is devoid of understandable language entirely. The game instead uses a system of animated thought bubbles. Easter egg backstory scenes in the same format can only be revealed by idling in certain areas.\n","\n","The game employs a two-tier hint system. Once per level, the player can receive a hint, which becomes increasingly vague as the game progresses. Machinarium also comes with a walkthrough, that can be accessed at any time by playing a minigame. As with dialogue, the walkthrough is not in written or spoken form, but instead a series of sketches describing the puzzle at hand and its solution. However, the walkthrough only reveals what must be done in that area, and not how that puzzle relates to the game chronology.\n","\n","Plot summary[edit]\n","\n","Machinarium opens with an overview of the eponymous city as a disposal flier launches from the pinnacle of its highest tower.  The player character, a robot called Josef (named after Josef Čapek, the creator of the word \"robot\" and brother to Karel Čapek)[17] is dumped on a scrapheap, where he re-assembles himself and sets off for the city. Entering the city, he discovers a plot by the Black Cap Brotherhood, the three criminal antagonists, to blow up the city's tower. He himself is then discovered and locked up.  After breaking out of prison, Josef aids the citizens of the city, as he discovers the mischief which the Brotherhood has been working.  Shortly after flooding the Brotherhood's room (leaving them incapacitated), Josef locates his girlfriend Berta,[18] who has been locked up and forced to cook. Unable to free her, he works his way to the top of the tower. After he foils the Black Cap Brotherhood's plot by disarming the bomb taped to the tower, Josef reaches the highest room, in which the story began.  A huge-headed robot, the \"head\" of the city, sits in the middle of the room, incapacitated and gibbering. Josef recalls how the three of them lived happily until the Black Cap Brotherhood zapped this friend, leaving him disabled, and kidnapped Berta. When a garbage sucker arrived to dispose of the Black Cap thug, it apprehended Josef instead.  After this revelation, Josef restores his friend to sanity, dumps the Brotherhood down a drain, and frees Berta. The two of them climb back to the tower, wave goodbye to their friend, and fly off into the sunset.  In the final closing scene, their vehicle suffers a collision and falls, and they are seen being carried away separately by two fliers.\n","\n","\n","Plot[edit]\n","\n","Mad Father takes place in northern Germany, where the 11-year-old protagonist Aya Drevis lives with her father Alfred and their maid Maria. Aya is a shy girl who never goes outside. Her mother, Monika Drevis, was incredibly ill, and presumably died of illness before the occurrence of the game. Her father performs secret research in his laboratory in the house's basement, with the assistance of Maria. Aya is aware that Alfred experiments on and kills humans in the basement, as well as the fact that he is involved in an extramarital affair with the younger Maria, a former homeless woman he had taken off the street some years prior.\n","\n","On the anniversary of Monika's death, the very beginning of the game, Aya awakens at midnight to find herself surrounded by test subjects that escaped from the laboratory. Fleeing back into her room, Aya encounters the mysterious salesman Ogre, who offers her the task of solving puzzles to break into her father's laboratory and uncover his secret. Aya discovers that her father had intended to perform taxidermy on her and convert her into a doll, as he had done to numerous other children, having been enamored with preserving humans after having killed his own mother as a youth.[1] Aya soon discovers that her father killed her mother in fear of her mother taking Aya away to prevent him from performing taxidermy on her.\n","\n","The game has three endings based on the player's choices. In one ending, Aya allows her undead mother to take her father away to another world. After returning to the real world, she runs into Maria, who knocks her out, takes her to the basement and then kills her, turning her corpse into a doll. In the second ending, Aya saves her father from being taken by her mother's spirit. However, after doing so, Monika reveals to Aya that Alfred murdered her for one of his experiments. Horrified, Aya flees while being chased by a chainsaw-wielding Alfred. While attempting to escape, she runs into Maria. Maria attempts to follow her, but when she fails to capture her, Alfred attacks Maria. The game then branches into two endings depending on Aya's actions; if Aya neglects to help Maria and instead attempts to escape the mansion, she is found by her father and killed, with Alfred performing taxidermy on her corpse and rendering her into one of his dolls. In the true ending, Aya helps Maria, declaring that the two shall henceforth live together. Maria then kills Alfred and the two women leave the mansion, which is burned down by Robin, the spirit of one of Alfred's human test subjects.\n","\n","While walking away from the burning mansion, Aya notices that her father's medical book has survived the blaze, and decides to take it with her as she and Maria start their lives anew. Meanwhile, inside the burning house, Ogre transports Alfred's spirit to another world, where he is free to experiment to his heart's content, creating a mature adult clone of his daughter, leading into the events of Misao. Some years later, Aya and Maria have created a clinic, where they perform medical services free of charge. A poor woman named Jean Rooney arrives for an examination, and Aya uses anesthesia to render Jean unconscious, claiming that Jean will no longer suffer from her illnesses. In another room, Maria muses that Aya has become just like her father and that the tendencies run in the family, heavily implying that Aya has followed in her father's footsteps.\n","\n","In an extra scene at the end of the game, you can play through an ending called \"if\" where the player can play as Robin. It is revealed in this scene that Robin is actually a living boy, brought back to life by Monika's power.\n","\n","In the Remake of the game, a new epilogue is included, with an adult Aya trapped in a nightmare version of the house. It is revealed that Aya was actually evil from the start, as she has flashbacks to hurting animals, with her father telling her to say sorry when she hurts something, leading her to say sorry even though she doesn't mean it throughout the main game. Through diary entries, journal entries, and letters scattered throughout the house, it is revealed that Monika was trying to make the perfect successor to her family's demonic tendencies and that Aya inherited her tendencies and not Alfred's. Through Monika's letters with her grandfather, it is revealed that she met Alfred in prison, and arranged to marry him and have a child when he got out, as he was a serial killer at the time, making him a perfect choice. Alfred finds out about it years later, and it leads to him planning to turn Aya into a doll with Maria, ending Monika's cursed bloodline, and Monika planning to run away with Aya, leading into the main game. Aya manages to escape the house once again and scoffs at it as it burns down, and she wakes up in her clinic, ready to start a new day.\n","\n","\n","Gameplay[edit]\n","\n","Mad Rat Dead is a rhythm-based platform game in which players control Mad Rat in time to the beat of the music, with the goal of making it safely to the end of each stage. Mad Rat is able to dash forward, jump, drop downwards, and perform a dance to charge up a super dash, as well as perform homing attacks on enemies known as Nightmares. If Mad Rat dies by colliding with an enemy or deadly obstacle, the player can rewind time to restart at a chosen point before death (players can also rewind time on command). However, the game will end if the player fails to reach the end of the stage before a timer runs out. Stages that are cleared in story mode can be replayed with any unlocked music tracks, allowing them to be played at different speeds depending on the music. Additionally, stages can be played in Hard Mode, which adds additional beats that need to be hit.[2]\n","\n","\n","None\n","Plot[edit]\n","\n","The game is set in the land of Mystralia and follows Zia, a mage who discovers her magical powers at the beginning of the game. After being exiled from her village due to unintentionally causing turmoil through her powers, she meets a character self-described as the Mentor, who convinces her to travel to a mage sanctuary to improve her skills as a mage. Zia is eventually tasked with preventing a war between an army of trolls and the anti-mage Kingdom of Mystralia, whilst learning more of her destiny and uncovering a more sinister plot.\n","\n","\n","Plot[edit]\n","\n","Near the end of the Shōwa era, in Misaki town, an old mansion is rumored to be the home of a witch. After moving there, Aoko Aozaki begins to learn sorcery from a young mage, Alice Kuonji, the rumored witch of the mansion. The Aozaki family oversees the land on which Misaki is built and the heir (Aoko) is tasked with protecting it. Mysterious intruders have been disrupting the bounded field in Misaki, leading Alice and Aoko to investigate. A mannequin or puppet attacks them and is incinerated. As this happens, both of them spot someone running away, a civilian who must not get away having seen magic alive. Unexpectedly, a young boy named Sōjūrō Shizuki is drawn to the mansion and comes to reside with them as well. Eventually, it is revealed that the intruder who had been disrupting the bounded field is Touko Aozaki, Aoko's older sister. She, having killed their grandfather, now seeks to unveil the Aozaki's path to the root.\n","\n","\n","Gameplay[edit]\n","\n","The game is an action role-playing game played from a third-person perspective. In the game, the player assumes control of a baby bull shark who must take revenge on a shark hunter named Scaly Pete, who killed its mother and disfigured it.[1] The shark has several basic attacks, including charging into enemies, siloing out of the water and whipping enemies with its tail to stun them.[2] It can also use its surroundings for combat advantages, such as using a swordfish as a spear.[3] The shark needs to hunt and consume other aquatic wildlife such as fish and turtles in order to obtain nutrients, namely proteins, fats, minerals and rare mutagenics. Players can also attack humans by wreaking havoc along the coast, destroying yachts and ships, and knocking people off jet skis.[4] As the player gains enough nutrients, the shark must enter underwater grottos to unlock new abilities and increase in size, which allows the shark to take on larger and deadlier creatures.[5] The shark will slowly evolve into an adult \"mega\" shark, and players can acquire advanced upgrades and customization options such as external bone plates, shadow armor, and electromagnetic spikes to further enhance the shark's combat abilities.\n","\n","Playing as the shark, players can freely explore the open world of Port Clovis, which consists of eight regions: Caviar Keys, Crawfish Bay, Dead Horse Lake, Fawtick Bayou, Golden Shores, Prosperity Sands, Sapphire Bay, and the Gulf.[5] Players can discover hidden landmarks and complete side objectives. While each region will have other predators that will attack the player, such as muskellunge, barracuda, alligators, sperm whales, orcas, and even other sharks, they will also have their own apex predator, which is larger, and differing in appearance than their normal species. The apex predators are a great barracuda, a shortfin mako, an American alligator, a great hammerhead, a great white, an orca, and an albino sperm whale. Defeating these predators will earn the player special skills. As the shark creates more havoc, the world will react by dispatching human bounty hunters to hunt it down. If the shark manages to kill the ten lead hunters,[6] which are named characters, it will receive additional rewards.[7] The game is narrated by Trip Westhaven (voiced by Chris Parnell), the host of an in-game reality TV show titled Maneaters vs. Sharkhunters, who guides the player throughout the game.[8]\n","\n","Plot[edit]\n","\n","A film crew for a reality television show follows experienced Cajun shark hunter Pierre \"Scaly Pete\" LeBlanc (Carlo Mestroni) and his son Kyle (Raphael Grosz-Harvey) as they hunt for an adult bull shark with a harpoon in its side owned by Scaly Pete's father. They manage to capture the shark after it goes on a killing spree at a beach. Upon discovering that the bull shark is pregnant, the film crew is shocked when Scaly Pete cuts out the infant shark and uses his knife to identify it later as it grows before letting it go, though he loses his right hand in the process.\n","\n","The infant shark grows larger over time by eating fish, aquatic mammals and reptiles, humans, and apex predators. Other shark hunters eventually go after the shark, but are also killed and eaten. Back on Scaly Pete's boat, the Cajun Queen, tensions grow between him and his son over claims that Scaly Pete's father was killed by a megalodon, even though it is believed to have been extinct for over two million years. They eventually relocate the shark and attempt to kill it. They try burning the shark alive after it eats Scaly Pete's left leg, but the shark escapes, and Kyle is killed in an explosion that causes the Cajun Queen to sink and leaves Scaly Pete disfigured.\n","\n","As the shark continues to grow, the film crew grows concerned for Scaly Pete's sanity after losing Kyle as he prepares to use extreme methods to kill the shark. He eventually repairs and arms his father's old PT 522 navy patrol boat with military-grade firepower. He attacks the film crew after they attempt to talk him out of it and sets out to kill the shark, which has by now evolved into a megashark, measuring 10 m (33 ft) in length. The shark ultimately gets the upper hand on Scaly Pete, who in a last-ditch effort, plans to use explosives to kill himself and the shark. While Scaly Pete dies in the explosion, the Shark ultimately survives and retreats to an underwater cave to recover.\n","\n","\n","Gameplay[edit]\n","\n","The game takes place in a \"universe with a different set of physical laws\" where the player can manipulate gravity, being able to \"turn walls into floors\".[6] The player must solve puzzles using the world's geometry in addition to devices within the architecture of the world.[6] To aid the player, the world's tone takes on one of six colors depending on which direction they have manipulated gravity. Several facets of the game's world may only be interacted with when the gravity is oriented directly, with these objects sharing one of the six colors.\n","\n","The game's worlds frequently appear to repeat into infinity into all directions. Because of this, many puzzles revolve around falling off a ledge from a lower part of a structure to land back on the top of the next version of that structure below.[7] Later puzzles will involve growing trees and natural elements to bring life back to the \"sterile\" world.[3]\n","\n","\n","Gameplay[edit]\n","\n","Like previous Mario & Sonic titles, Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games Tokyo 2020 is a sports game featuring a crossover cast of characters from Nintendo's Super Mario and Sega's Sonic the Hedgehog series.[3] The player, using one of the characters, competes in a multitude of events based on sports from the Olympic Games. The game features a variety of events; returning ones from previous Mario & Sonic titles include boxing, soccer, swimming, and gymnastics, while new ones include karate, skateboarding, sport climbing, and surfing.[4]\n","\n","The Nintendo Switch version supports a variety of controllers, including the Joy-Con motion controllers.[4][5] The game also features single system split-screen multiplayer, LAN multiplayer, and online play.[4] An additional 2D Mode is also included, based on the 1964 Summer Olympics, and featuring 8-bit and 16-bit styles for Mario and Sonic, respectively. These 2D Mode events have more limited controls and the option to enable a CRT overlay to further emulate the feel of games of that era.[6]\n","\n","There are thirty-two playable characters in the game. Similar to the Wii U version of the previous game, the series' regulars since the second game are playable in all events while the other twelve are only playable in one event as a guest. Guest characters include Larry Koopa, Wendy O. Koopa, Ludwig von Koopa, Diddy Kong, Rosalina, Toadette (who is the game's sole newcomer), Dr. Eggman Nega, Jet the Hawk, Rouge the Bat, Zavok, Zazz, and Espio the Chameleon.[7]\n","\n","\n","Gameplay[edit]\n","\n","Gameplay follows Mario and a cast of other Mario and Rabbids characters of the player's choosing, including Luigi, Princess Peach, Yoshi, and four other Rabbids dressed up as a respective Mario character with exaggerated personalities.[1] They are guided by a small robot named Beep-0.[2] The campaign story mode is split up into four unique locations, or \"worlds\", each of which has a linear path to completion. In each world, some puzzles must be completed for progression, or give weapons and collectibles when solved.[3] When a world is completed, Beep-0 learns a new ability to solve puzzles.[3]\n","\n","If the team comes across territory inhabited by enemy Rabbids, a battle will commence. While the goal of each battle is usually to defeat every enemy on the field, some levels have a fixed objective, such as escorting a Toad to the end of the stage. The level is completed if all enemies are defeated or the fixed objective is satisfied; the player loses when all characters run out of health or fail to meet their goal. Before a battle, the player can choose to change their current selection of characters and weaponry; three out of eight playable characters can fight in a battle (Mario and at least one Rabbid being required), and each fighter can be equipped with weapons, each one dealing different amounts of damage or causing certain special effects that hinder the opponent. Battles are turn-based, and each character can perform up to three different options: they can move to a new location, with each character having a set distance they can travel; they can use a weapon, and have two choices of attack that vary per player; or they can use a special effect, with each character having different abilities that vary in function.[3] If a player moves to a location where they are obscured to the enemy, the enemy's accuracy changes based on the cover's effectiveness.[4] Characters also have movement abilities, where they can dash into an enemy to deal damage or be boosted by another character to travel a further distance. Some weapons have special effects; for example, the player can shoot a glob of honey at the enemy to restrict them from moving temporarily, or shoot an ignited bullet to burn an opponent and send them running around in a random direction in panic. Special effects also vary, such as a healing effect that restores some health to other characters, or a hypnosis effect that draws enemies towards the character that used it.[1]\n","\n","Levels are divided into chapters, and each chapter usually contains three levels. When a chapter is completed, characters receive coins and \"Skill Orbs\", which can also be found by exploring the overworld, with greater rewards earned clearing battles within a certain number of turns with all characters intact. Skill Orbs can be used in each character's skill tree to grant them new abilities or increase stats such as health or movement distance.[5][3] Coins can be used to purchase new weaponry and items.[2]\n","\n","Plot[edit]\n","\n","\n","Gameplay[edit]\n","\n","Gameplay in Sparks of Hope is largely similar to that of Kingdom Battle. Players are able to build out their roster of characters from, Rabbid Peach, Rabbid Luigi, and Rabbid Mario, along with new characters Edge, Rabbid Rosalina, and Bowser (with the Rabbids being fully voiced for the first time).[3] Players are also tasked with rescuing the Sparks throughout the galaxy, who provide distinct powers that will help the player in battle.[4]\n","\n","Unlike the first game, level designs are less linear, and the turn-based tactical combat features a new system that disregards the first game's grid-based layout.[5][6] Also featured are enemy encounters outside of turn-based combat. Mario can now be replaced by a different character. Lead designer Xavier Manzanares, speaking about the new combat, stated: \"You can move in this area of movement the way you want; you can dash a Bob-omb, then you have it in your hand. You can move around as you want, but then it's going to explode. So, you have a few seconds to react, which is completely different from what we had in the past. And so, it brings this real-time element to the mix\".[5]\n","\n","Plot[edit]\n","\n","\n","Gameplay[edit]\n","\n","The fundamental gameplay of Mario Golf: Super Rush is comparable to previous entries in the Mario Golf series. Through traditional golf rules, the player's primary objective is to get the ball into each hole with the fewest possible number of strokes, using the various golf clubs available to them. The player who completes the game with the lowest number of strokes is the winner of the match in the context of competition. Multiple tools are available to players for strategic benefit, such as the \"Shot Gauge\" showing the direction and the curve of the ball against slopes and the scan feature, which allows the player to better assess the elevation of terrain.[2] The game offers both conventional button controls for taking shots and motion controls to simulate hitting the ball with a swing.[2]\n","\n","Speed Golf, a newly introduced mode for the Mario Golf series, has players race to complete courses in the fastest time, rather than with the fewest strokes. After each swing, players must run across the course toward their ball to take their next shot, dealing with other players and obstacles along the way. Each character in the game's roster has unique Special Shot and Special Dash abilities to take advantage of. For example, Luigi has the ability to freeze the ground.[2] Another new mode called Battle Golf also makes its debut. Battle Golf resembles Speed Golf mechanically but differs in that it takes place on a special arena-course where players have to sink the ball in any 3 of the 9 open holes first to win.[3]\n","\n","Additionally, the game features a story mode titled \"Golf Adventure\" that includes role-playing game elements like gaining experience and stat progression.[2] Players control their own customizable Mii as they become students in a country club, train, and face-off against classmates from the Mushroom Kingdom.[4][5][6]\n","\n","\n","Gameplay[edit]\n","\n","Mario Kart 8 is a kart racing game; players control characters from the Mario universe to race in go-karts around a course. They may hinder their opponents or improve their performance using power-ups found in item boxes throughout the course.[1] It includes four different difficulties, each differing in speed, which may be selected before the race.[2][3] \"Mirror Mode\" horizontally inverts all courses.[4] Returning features from previous installments include motorbikes and 12-player racing from Mario Kart Wii, as well as hang gliders, underwater racing and vehicle customization from Mario Kart 7.[5][6] Up to four players can play together on a single system, up to eight can play together through a local wireless connection, and up to twelve can play together via online multiplayer.[3][7]\n","\n","The signature new feature of Mario Kart 8 is anti-gravity racing, in which certain parts of a course allow racers to drive on walls and ceilings.[8] In these sections, players who collide with other racers or special bumpers will trigger a speed boost. New characters include the Koopalings and Pink Gold Peach. In addition to karts and motorbikes, the game also includes all-terrain vehicles. There are four new items: the Boomerang Flower, which can be thrown to attack players; the Piranha Plant, which attacks nearby racers and obstacles and provides a speed boost; the Crazy Eight, which gives the user eight different items; and the Super Horn, which can be used both to attack nearby opponents and defend against items, including the previously nearly unavoidable Spiny Shell.[9][10][11] The game features 32 courses spread across eight cups, with an additional 16 courses later released as downloadable content (DLC) in four additional cups.[12]\n","\n","\n","Gameplay[edit]\n","\n","Players build racing playsets around the house. The radio controlled cars are equipped with video cameras,[2] controlled via the Nintendo Switch.[3] The track has many traditional Mario Kart items.[4] The game supports up to 4 players,[5] either human or AI.[6] The Grand Prix mode has the player race against Bowser Jr. and the Koopalings,[7] and unlocks new customization options and costumes for the playable characters.[8] The level creation in Home Circuit is performed by placing guidance arrows along four gates to make checkpoints which advance the player through the five-lap race.[9]\n","\n","\n","Gameplay[edit]\n","\n","Mario Party Superstars features gameplay similar to the first eight entries in the Mario Party series, without the vehicle mechanics from the previous two numbered console games. Four characters, played by either humans or AI, traverse one of five boards in the game, collecting coins and stars. The player with the most stars at the end of the game wins. Stars are bought for twenty coins from Toadette, though can also be obtained via other methods. During a turn, each player rolls a die, enabling them to move the result of the roll - one to ten. Additionally, items may be used to affect themselves or other players. Between every round of four players moving, a randomly-selected minigame of 100 is played. All 100 minigames are taken from the previous entries in the series, 55 of which originate from the original N64 trilogy.\n","\n","\"Mt. Minigames\" is another mode, allowing players to freely play minigames without boards.\n","\n","All playable characters from the first three entries return, while Birdo and Rosalina are added.\n","\n","\n","Gameplay[edit]\n","\n","Mario Strikers: Battle League is a five versus five soccer video game.[1] The game shies away from realism, in favor of chaotic, over-the-top gameplay.[1] The game maintains the main premise of the sport, where players maneuver players around a field in efforts to pass and shoot a ball into a goal to score points, with the team with the most points at the end of a game winning the game.[2] However, the game takes many liberties with the sport.[3] Aggressive tackles and attacks are completely allowed, though they give the opposing player \"items\" to use at their disposal.[4] Items often function in the same way as  Mario Kart or Mario Tennis - banana peels can be placed on the field and characters will slip on them, while shells can be shot at characters to temporarily knock them over.[3][5] No \"out of bounds\" exists on the field, instead, an electric fence is placed around the field; players can check and knock opponents into this fence to stun them.[6] Additionally, collecting a glowing orb that appears on the field allows the player to perform a \"Hyper Strike\" and score a 2-point goal if the move is charged up without interruption.[3][6]\n","\n","In the game, the player picks a major Mario franchise character like Mario or Princess Peach - and a team of three other characters to round out the rest of the team.[7] All characters have various strengths and weaknesses, and Battle League additionally allows for the customization of equipment on characters as well, affecting character's stats for things like speed, strength, and pass accuracy.[5][8]\n","\n","Up to eight players can play local multiplayer matches, with players using just one Joy-Con each, allowing for four versus four game, with the computer handling goalkeeping.[5] Online multiplayer is also available, including a \"Club Mode\" where groups of up to 20 players can create their own game season, with leaderboards tracking scores.[5]\n","\n","\n","Gameplay[edit]\n","\n","The gameplay of Mario Tennis Aces consists of playing matches of tennis with various characters from the Super Mario series. Players can pick from Mario, Luigi, Wario, Peach, Waluigi, Daisy, Rosalina, Yoshi, Donkey Kong, Bowser, Toad, Toadette, Chain Chomp, Bowser Jr., Boo, and Spike.[2][3] New characters are added by participating in monthly tournaments, or are added to the roster the following month if the player does not participate. Numerous characters have been added in the game such as; Koopa Troopa in July 2018, Blooper in August 2018, Diddy Kong in September 2018, Birdo in October 2018, Koopa Paratroopa in November 2018, Petey Piranha and Shy Guy in December 2018, Luma in January 2019, Boom Boom in February 2019, Pauline in March 2019, Kamek in April 2019, Dry Bones in May 2019, Fire Piranha Plant in June 2019, and Dry Bowser in July 2019.[4][5]\n","\n","Similar in fashion to previous installments of the series, Aces incorporates many techniques, such as \"topspins\", where the ball travels parallel to the direction hit, \"slices\", where the ball curves to one side when hit, and \"lobs\", where the ball travels upwards.[6]\n","\n","Aces adds several new mechanics to the Mario Tennis series. Using the motion controls of the Joy-Con, the player is able to initiate a \"zone shot\", where the player can aim directly where the ball will go while the game enters a paused state.[7] If the opponent counters the zone shot, their racket will take damage.[8] When a racket is hit with a zone shot three times, it will break, forcing the player to forfeit the match if it is their last one. Players have multiple rackets to use each match.[9] However, players are able to counter a zone shot without taking damage using a \"block\", which can be performed by hitting the ball with perfect timing.\n","\n","Another new addition in Aces is \"zone speed\". When a player activates zone speed, the match goes into slow-motion, but their character moves at normal speed, making it so faraway shots are easier to reach.[6] The zone shot and zone speed moves use up part of the players' energy gauge, which is filled and depleted throughout the match. To refill the gauge, the player must keep a rally going with the opponent or use the trick shot ability.[10][11]\n","\n","The trick shot ability enables the player to quickly travel to where the ball will land.[12] If the trick shot succeeds, then the player's energy gauge will increase dramatically. However, it is easy to misjudge the timing and therefore is a risky move to make. Another ability available to players at the cost of their energy gauge is the special shot. To activate it, the player must have a full energy gauge. The ability unleashes an extremely powerful shot that has the power to break the opponent's racket regardless of its current damage. However, the special shot can be blocked similarly to the zone shot.\n","\n","Aces also has a \"simple rules\" mode, where only simple shots are allowed and zone shots, zone speed, trick shots, special shots and the energy gauge are nonexistent.[2]\n","\n","The game also features an online multiplayer mode, where tournaments can be set up, as well as singular matches.[13] Players can unlock additional outfits and characters by participating in special online Tournaments held by Nintendo. Another gameplay mode is \"swing mode\", where players are able to swing the Joy-Con controllers to simulate hitting the ball with a tennis racket, similar in fashion to Wii Sports and the New Play Control! version of Mario Power Tennis.[14] In addition to regular tennis matches, the game offers a story mode similar in fashion to Mario Tennis: Power Tour.[15]\n","\n","Plot[edit]\n","\n","Wario and Waluigi are mining at the Temple of Bask when they discover a treasure chest containing Lucien, a magical racket said to be legendary to those who would possess it. The duo perceive themselves as displaying pride at matches using Lucien, and open up the treasure chest to unveil it. Just as they obtain Lucien, the racket unveils its power and shocks the duo.\n","\n","The duo soon emerge at Marina Stadium, immediately following a championship match in which Mario and Peach won against Bowser and Bowser Jr. The duo attempt to offer Lucien to Mario, but Luigi snatches it up, after which it begins to take possession of him, Wario, and Waluigi, through use of its grip tape. Mario and Toad then embark on a journey to destroy Lucien and save Wario, Luigi and Waluigi, on Daisy's promise that Luigi will be brought back safely.\n","\n","Mario and Toad soon arrive at the Bask Ruins, where they meet Aster, guardian of King Bask and watcher over Lucien. Aster tells the backstory of Lucien and how many years ago, King Bask stripped Lucien's power and divided it among five Power Stones hidden on the island, and years later the room fell to ruin, breaking the seal and allowing the racket to fall into new hands. Aster requests that Mario find the Power Stones to end Lucien, once and for all.\n","\n","Mario obtains the first three Power Stones by defeating Petey Piranha in Piranha Plant Forest, The Mirror Queen in Mirage Mansion, and the Snow Ogre at the summit of Snowfall Mountain respectively. Mario tries to claim the Power Stones in the Savage Sea and Inferno Island, but they are claimed by Wario, Waluigi, and Luigi. Wario and Waluigi decide to settle the score at Marina Stadium; whoever wins receives all five Power Stones.\n","\n","The Princesses take on Wario and Waluigi while Mario takes on Luigi, with slight power given to the Princesses and Mario by Aster, respectively. They win, allowing them to receive the Power Stones, but Bowser gets ahold of Lucien before this can happen, and makes off to the Temple of Bask with it. Mario confronts him inside the Temple and not only defeats him, but breaks Lucien causing the entire Temple to collapse. With the spirit of King Bask now able to rest in peace, Aster thanks Mario for his heroism throughout the quest.\n","\n","Back outside, everyone celebrates Mario's victory in banishing Lucien and saving Luigi, Wario and Waluigi, although the latter two are shamed by Daisy for attempting to use Lucien to be the best tennis players. The gang agrees that getting stronger is better than trying to control others.\n","\n","\n","Gameplay[edit]\n","\n","Mark of the Ninja consists of stealth-oriented 2D platforming. The character is required to sneak through a series of environments while staying out of sight of guards and performing silent assassinations. Levels are divided into areas of light and darkness; the player character is visible to enemies in the former and invisible in the latter, though passing within a certain immediate distance of an enemy's face results in the player being spotted irrespective of lighting. Sounds such as running may also give away the player character's location and are represented visually by a rapidly expanding circle.[3] Unusual for a platformer, Mark of the Ninja employs a line of sight mechanic, meaning that enemies which would be invisible to the character are also invisible to the player, though their sounds are represented on screen in the same manner as the player character's.[4]\n","\n","By approaching enemies undetected, the player character is able to execute a \"one-hit\" kill. To facilitate this, the player can extinguish light sources, hide behind objects and pass through narrow grates and shafts inaccessible to enemies.[5] If detected, they must evade their enemies and remain out of sight for a set period of time, after which enemies will return to their original patrol routes and one-hit kills on them will once more be possible. Although fighting hand-to-hand with the goal of quickly disabling an enemy is possible, doing so risks being killed or disabled in turn, as well as alerting nearby enemies with a noisy scuffle. Enemies respond to their environment and one another; they will sound an alarm if they unambiguously spot the player character or find a body, which will alert all enemies in the area and prevent them from returning to their previous patrol routes. If they hear a sound or get a glimpse of the player character they become suspicious, displaying a question mark over their head and actively searching for the player character until they are convinced he is not actually present. They are also subject to terror tactics, and the player can learn to kill and display enemies in a terrifying manner, such as leaving a strangled enemy dangling from a perch or throwing a dead body at an unsuspecting live enemy, causing them to display an exclamation mark over their head, scream, stumble, and fire wildly at anything which scares or startles them.[5]\n","\n","The player receives points for executing a variety of tactics such as silent kills, passing by enemies without being detected, successfully preventing the discovery of bodies, terrorizing opponents to cause them to fall into disarray, and achieving optional goals such as recovering artifacts and a series of haiku which tell the history of the ninja clan.[3] This score is reduced when an alert is sounded by enemy guards. Depending on the player's performance on the stages, they earn honor and complete seals that are used to buy or upgrade skills and weapons and also unlock alternate costumes. Players get honor by reaching a specific score on each stage, collecting the secret scrolls, and completing the special objectives present in each stage. Some of the scrolls are obtained through secret challenges, where the player is transported to a room to solve a puzzle.[6]\n","\n","Before each mission the player is taken to an upgrade screen, where they can spend their honor in three sections: Techniques (passive upgrades and skills such as new one-hit executions), Distraction Items (such as smoke bombs and firecrackers) and Attack Items (such as caltrops and poison-tipped darts). The next screen allows the player to select any unlocked costumes and equip items.[7] Each costume (except the starting one) gives special bonuses, but also a side effect in order to balance its power, and must be unlocked by completing a number of seals in the form of optional goals related to the specialty of that costume (for instance, optionally terrorizing enemies in specific ways to unlock a costume which improves the ability to terrorize). Completing the game once unlocks a New Game Plus mode where the enemies behave more intelligently and can kill the player with only a single bullet or hand-to-hand strike, the player's line of sight is limited to a cone aimed in whatever direction the player is facing (preventing players from seeing what is behind, above, or below them unless they turn to look), the player is unable to see the enemy's line of sight and must intuit it from the direction an enemy's face is pointed, and the player can no longer detect the radius at which their actions will be heard by enemies.[8]\n","\n","Plot[edit]\n","\n","The game's story begins with an attack by a heavily armed force on the dojo of the Hisomu ninja clan. The unnamed ninja protagonist, resting after receiving an extensive irezumi tattoo, is awakened by a female ninja named Ora. Gathering his equipment, the protagonist is able to defeat the attackers and rescue his sensei, Azai, as well as several other members of the clan. Before being rescued by the protagonist, Azai was being blamed by the attackers, who said \"you picked the wrong people to steal from\". However, Azai simply claimed that the clan has been hidden from the modern world for centuries until now, when \"their enemies finally found them\". Azai tells him about the power of his tattoo and the legend surrounding it, explaining that the ink comes from a special desert flower and grants greatly sharpened senses and reflexes when absorbed slowly into the body, but will ultimately cause one so tattooed with it to descend into madness. In the distant past, the first Hisomu ninja to receive the Mark became incredibly dangerous, but increasingly deranged, leading to a lengthy reign of terror that only ended with his demise. Therefore, to receive the Mark, a ninja swears to commit seppuku once the madness begins to take hold.\n","\n","After the protagonist receives his second tattoo, he and Ora are tasked to take revenge on the PMC responsible for the attack on the dojo: a corporation called Hessian, run by a ruthless Eastern European plutocrat named Count Karajan. Meanwhile, the horishi artist Dosan expresses concern over the tattoo ink's quality and promises to learn why Azai has not procured a fresh supply. The protagonist invades Hessian's East Asian regional headquarters and murders Corporal Kelly, the Hessian employee who led the attack on the dojo, and, using a stolen GPS tracking unit, stalks Karajan to his castle in Eastern Europe and slays him. Upon returning home, the protagonist and Ora see that their clan has stolen a great deal of high tech military equipment from Hessian, leaving them to realize that Azai's plan had been to rob Karajan and replace the old Hisomu Path with a modern, technological approach to espionage. Instead of committing seppuku, the protagonist flees with Ora to find Dosan, who had left a message indicating that he had personally gone in search of the mysterious desert flower.\n","\n","Following his trail, the protagonist and Ora discover that Dosan has been captured by bandits, who are holding him hostage in a war-wracked Middle Eastern city and demanding that he Mark them with his remaining supply of the sumi ink. Upon being freed, Dosan explains that the flowers from whose leaves the sumi is produced have died out, and appear to have been dead at least since the last fresh supply of the ink was taken by the Hisomu clan. As revealed by hidden scrolls recounting the history of the clan, Azai himself had failed to defend the flowers when the devastated region to which they were endemic was taken over by vicious bandits. Thus dishonored, but for the sake of the clan's survival, Azai hid his failure and had planned the Hessian heist in order to supply the Hisomu with cutting-edge equipment now that the unique source of their strength had been extinguished. Finally, he ordered that the last of the sumi ink be used to Mark one final ninja, whose strength would enable the heist and save the clan itself from extinction at Hessian's hands. Dosan uses the remains of the sumi to give the protagonist his final tattoo, shortly before some of Azai's high tech ninja stalkers ambush them and shoot Dosan to death as he and the protagonist attempt to escape.\n","\n","Having left his equipment behind during the hasty retreat, the protagonist, now obviously hallucinating, uses the almost superhuman reflexes afforded to him by the final Mark to evade death at the hands of both the bandits and the Hisomu stalkers, and travels back to Japan with Ora, who recommends he kill Azai for the dishonor of failing to maintain the traditional Hisomu way. The protagonist uses his almost preternatural abilities to infiltrate past Hisomu-jo's new sophisticated defenses, and confronts Azai in his garden. When Ora arrives and commands the protagonist to slay Azai, Azai claims to be unable to see Ora, and, suggesting that she is a symptom of the protagonist's creeping madness, insists that he satisfy his honor and kill himself before he slips too far beyond reason. Suddenly uncertain, the protagonist is reassured by Ora that Azai is lying to deceive him, and she urges him to murder Azai and purge the dishonorable Hisomu clan who followed him. Upon retrieving the ritual sword, the protagonist experiences a brief psychotic fugue state, in which he symbolically relives the events of his life subsequent to taking on the Mark. He finds himself in a courtyard opposite both Ora and Azai, who kneels and places his own sheathed sword on the ground, awaiting the protagonist's choice.\n","\n","If the player chooses to kill Azai another psychotic episode follows, in which the protagonist murders his sensei and becomes the maniacal Hisomu tyrant of legend, melting silently into darkness with a swift strike of his sword. If the player chooses to kill Ora, the protagonist disembowels himself with the ritual sword and Ora dissolves into inky nothingness as the Marked ninja sputters his last breath and dies in the courtyard.\n","\n","\n","Gameplay[edit]\n","\n","The player first selects a space agency: NASA, European Space Agency, Russia, China, and Japan. The support to the agency provides money, and a tech tree unlocks missions, buildings, and rocket parts. The missions are milestones from the space race, such as launching the first satellite, the first human to outer space, the first probes to the planets in the Solar System, the Moon landing, etc. The later stages of the game focus on proposed missions that were not achieved yet, such as the first Mars sample-return mission, and ends with the first human mission to Mars.\n","\n","\n","None\n","Gameplay[edit]\n","\n","In Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy, the player assumes control of Peter Quill / Star-Lord from a third-person perspective. The player can utilize Star-Lord's elemental guns to defeat enemies.[1] His blasters have four alternate firing modes. Ice shots temporarily freeze enemies, lightning shots stun them, wind shots pull enemies far away towards Star-Lord, and Plasma shots induce fire damages to boss characters.[2][3] Other members of the titular team, which include Gamora, Rocket Raccoon, Groot, and Drax the Destroyer, are not directly playable as they are controlled by artificial intelligence. Players can enter Guardians Mode in order to issue commands to them during combat. Each character has four unique skills and abilities which can be chained together to inflict more damage.[4] Groot has excellent crowd control abilities in which he can use his roots to immobilize enemies, while Rocket Raccoon can deploy various explosives and bombs. Drax can easily stagger enemies, while Gamora can use her sword to deal powerful damages against a single opponent.[5] However, these abilities have a short cooldown time. Guardians can also use environmental hazards to their advantage. For instance, players can instruct Drax to hurl a large boulder at enemies.[6] At several sections of the game, the player can directly control the Guardians' ship, the Milano, and combat hostile spaceships.[3]\n","\n","As Star-Lord and the Guardians engage in combat, the player's performance will be rated using the Momentum gauge. Once the player has maximized the team's momentum, they can perform a \"Call-to-Action\" attack, which deals significant damages to stronger enemies.[2] Certain enemies has a \"stagger bar\". Once an opponent's stagger bar is depleted, they will be temporarily stunned, opening a window for players to attack.[7] Once the enemy is defeated, they will drop health pick-ups, which will refill Star-Lord's health. As the player progresses in the game, they will earn experience points. These points can be used to unlock new abilities for both Star-Lord and other Guardians.[2] As the player fight enemies, a meter will build up and allow players to unleash a special ability known as \"Team Huddle\", which briefly stops combat and prompts Star-Lord to make a motivational speech and play a song to inspire his teammates. A good speech will grant the other Guardians gameplay benefits, though Star-Lord's abilities will be boosted regardless of the quality of the speech. Players must listen to what other Guardians are saying before they choose the best options.[3][8]\n","\n","While the game is mostly linear, players are encouraged to explore each location in order to find components, collectibles, and costumes. Players can use Star-Lord's visor to scan the environment and identify objects of interest.[5] At workbenches, Rocket can use these components to craft combat perks for Star-Lord, such as granting him passive advantages such as increased health and shield regeneration.[9] The player needs to use Star-Lord's jet boots to navigate the environment. Occasionally, players also need to request the help of other Guardians in order to progress. For instance, Rocket can use his engineering skills to open locked doors, allowing the team to reach areas which are otherwise inaccessible.[10] At various points of the game, the player can make key decisions, via dialogue trees, that will affect the relationships between the Guardians and the outcomes of certain missions. Throughout the game, Star-Lord's decisions will be referenced by his teammates.[11] Players can also engage in optional conservations with other Guardians members at the Milano, after the player gifted an object of interest to these compaions.[12] Despite the branching dialogue paths, the core story remains the same and the game has one ending.[13]\n","\n","\n","Gameplay[edit]\n","\n","Players take the role of \"The Hunter\", the sole offspring of Lilith, as they lead a selection of heroes in various missions to defeat her. The Hunter, a customizable superhero created specifically for Midnight Suns by Firaxis Games in collaboration with Marvel, can be played as either male or female.[5][6][7] Players are able to choose The Hunter's superpowers from over 30 different abilities.[8]\n","\n","Combat is turn-based similar to Firaxis Games' XCOM series, mixed with deck-building similar to that found in Slay the Spire. Each hero, including the Hunter, has their own customizable deck of eight cards. At the start of each mission, players are allowed to choose three heroes to take into battle, with their decks combined into one that is to be drawn from each round.[9] The cards represent abilities that may affect either enemies or the player's own heroes.[9] Heroes may also move or interact with objects in addition to making attacks.\n","\n","Between combat missions, players manage their upgrade-able base of operations called \"The Abbey\" which they can walk around in a third-person view to explore the grounds and interact with other heroes.[5] Role-playing elements such as interaction with other characters influence the gameplay and those heroes' abilities.[5] The Abbey is also the main source for acquiring new cards for hero decks and upgrading them.\n","\n","\n","None\n","None\n","None\n","Plot[edit]\n","\n","\n","Plot[edit]\n","\n","\n","Gameplay[edit]\n","\n","Mega Man 11 retains the gameplay style of the classic Mega Man series of games, and features a 2.5D graphics style with 3D polygonal characters and 2D environments. Players control Mega Man in an attempt to stop Dr. Wily from using the Double Gear system that he invented many years before when he was at Robot University.  Players travel through eight linear stages, which can be chosen in any way the player sees fit, and have to face Doctor Wily's newest Robot Masters, including Block Man, Fuse Man, Blast Man, Acid Man, Tundra Man, Torch Man, Impact Man (known as Pile Man in Japan), and Bounce Man (known as Rubber Man in Japan). \n","\n","Mega Man can perform classic moves such as the chargeable Mega Buster and slide, as well as obtain new weapons by defeating Robot Master bosses at the end of each level. Unique to this game is the Double Gear system, which grants Mega Man two additional abilities: the Speed Gear and Power Gear. The Speed Gear lets Mega Man slow down time, allowing him to dodge attacks, while the Power Gear increases the attack power of Mega Man's weaponry, allowing him to fire two charged shots at the same time or a single, very powerful charged shot; however, there is a limit, showcased by a bar above Mega Man's head, so if Mega Man uses them too much, he will overheat, making him unable to reuse them again for a few seconds. When Mega Man's health is critically low, he can activate both gears at the same time, slowing time and performing a powerful charge shot. This can only be used once and leaves Mega Man weakened after the limit expires: he cannot charge his shots, can only fire a single solar bullet at a time and he will only have one unit of life energy, making the next hit he takes fatal for him, and even the cooldown period where he cannot use the gears is longer because of the severe strains.[2]\n","\n","The game has additional features including Time Trials, Missions, Global Leaderboards, a character gallery and more.[3] The game also features difficulty settings, last seen in Mega Man 10, expanding upon them for a total of four: Newcomer, Casual, Normal, and Superhero.[4] The Nintendo Switch version has Amiibo support, which can be used to unlock in-game items.[5]\n","\n","Plot[edit]\n","\n","The story begins with a flashback of Dr. Light and Dr. Wily when they were students at Robot University at the exact moment they had their falling  out. The committee is debating over choosing either Light's research of robots with independent thoughts or Wily's Double Gear system to continue work on. Despite Wily's objections to Light's ideologies, Light's research was chosen over Wily's. Enraged by his rejection, Wily swears revenge on Light. \n","After the flashback ends with Wily waking up disturbed, he suddenly remembers the Double Gear System and begins plotting.\n","\n","Meanwhile, at his lab, Light, Roll, and Auto are checking up on eight of the latest generation models of Robot Masters for maintenance. Just as they finish with one, Wily barges into the lab and tells Light that he has perfected the Double Gear system before using its Speed Gear to capture the Robot Masters. Mega Man demands Wily release them, but he instead leaves with the robots. Light explains to Mega Man about the Double Gear System and its capabilities, warning him that if Wily really has perfected it, he will not stand a chance. Seeing Mega Man's determination, Light reveals that he kept and repaired the prototype Double Gear System that Wily used to own. After briefly warning Mega Man of its risks, Light installs the Double Gear into Mega Man after several days to help him combat Wily's forces.\n","\n","After defeating four Robot Masters, Light explains to Mega Man that the Double Gear system was partly responsible for him and Wily falling out. Light believed that if robots were given the power to think for themselves, they could be true partners with humans. Wily, however, stated that even robots who think independently would be mere tools to humans, but by giving them power and speed boosts, then humans would finally respect robots for what they are and any robot could be a hero with the Double Gear System installed. However, when the committee chose Light over Wily, the latter stormed off never forgiving his old friend for not even giving him a chance.\n","\n","Back in the present, Light muses if he had shown him there was a way to work together instead of telling him that he was wrong, they might have remained friends. Light then gives Mega Man the Rush Jet modification for Rush (Mega Man's robotic pet dog) with Mega Man then setting off to defeat the remaining Robot Masters.\n","\n","After defeating all eight Robot Masters, Auto attempts to locate Wily, who angrily beckons Mega Man to come to his Gear Fortress so he can deal with him. In response, Mega Man heads to Wily's fortress, defeats his armies, defences and the Robot Masters, and confronts Wily in his new Wily Machine. Upon losing to Mega Man, Wily tries to beg for mercy in slow motion, but Mega Man does not fall for it, much to Wily's ire. Light arrives and tries to coax Wily to make amends, citing Mega Man as an example of their ideas working together, but Wily refuses and escapes, leaving Light dismayed. As the fortress begins to collapse, Auto arrives, telling Light he had finished doing what he asked of him. With that, the three of them escape the collapsing fortress.\n","\n","Back at the lab, Light reveals he and Auto went to the Gear Fortress to find the parts in order to rebuild the Robot Masters.

She warns them that the world is entering the 'CPU Shift Period', where the public will attempt to discredit and oust their CPUs in favor of newcomers. However, before Neptune and Nepgear can prepare properly, they stumble across an old video game console which, when activated, transports the pair to an alternate dimension; the Zero Dimension.\n","\n","Upon discovering this new dimension is a ruined wasteland inhabited only by monsters, the two are surprised to find a survivor, Uzume Tennouboshi, who is also a CPU. Neptune and Nepgear learn that, like Uzume, they are unable to transform to unlock their true powers in this world due to the absence of Shares (faith from the people) and so the trio journey across the land to locate fragments of power known as Share Crystals which they use to empower themselves enough to reclaim the land from the invading monster hoard.\n","\n","Neptune and Nepgear learn from Umio, Uzume's sentient fish-monster friend, that Uzume has unique abilities that may trigger when the party needs them most. She is also an amnesiac who remembers nothing of her people or the calamity which destroyed her world but believes it to be the work of a giant known as Dark Purple. Uzume's abilities soon begin to benefit the party by granting them Shares from friendly monsters, food, and finally the ability to seal Dark Purple in a pocket dimension; the Sharing Field, where the party are able to defeat her.\n","\n","Nepgear begins repairs on a transportation device to send herself and Neptune home but the facility is attacked by Arfoire; a powerful CPU-like being with a lust for destruction. Neptune was successfully transported home, but Nepgear, out of reflex, jumped out to help save Uzume from Arfoire's forces. This led the two to abandon their post and retreat. Back home, Neptune finds Histoire incapacitated due to her being an artificial life-form who overloaded as a result of her linking the two dimensions to bring Neptune home. With intel from the other CPUs, Neptune sets out to find an ancient artifact belonging to the original CPU of Planeptune which can reboot and upgrade Histoire. Neptune acquires the artifact from a hidden dungeon and begins to restore Histoire, hoping she can bring Nepgear home.\n","\n","Meanwhile, in the Zero Dimension, Nepgear and Uzume attempt to regroup at Uzume's base but are intercepted by Arfoire. Fortunately, the two are able to defeat and capture her with assistance from an alternate, older Neptune. The older Neptune reveals that she is a dimension traveler who comes from a Planeptune under the rule of Plutia (a close friend from the previous game, who rules in another dimension, the Ultra Dimension) who came to the Zero Dimension with the power of Croire (a dimension-crossing antagonist, also from the previous game) after capturing her, though Croire has since escaped.\n","\n","Arfoire manages to escape by manipulating the party and tracks down Croire, resulting in a formidable new alliance. The party are unable to defeat Arfoire who has stolen power from Croire to boost her own, but successfully recaptures Croire. With her enhanced abilities, Arfoire frees Dark Purple from the pocket dimension and fuses with it, though the party are able to re-confine the fused deity by boosting Uzume's powers with Planeptune's shares, creating a cross-dimensional portal in the process. Neptune rejoins the party through the portal and aids the group in destroying the giant deity, though the portal's temperamental nature causes Neptune and Nepgear to return home after the battle, and a heartwarming farewell to their new friend Uzume.

Noire tries to aid Lastation by defeating the new monsters which are attacking civilians but risks capture by being in the public eye. Eventually, Noire is tracked to K-Sha's location and K-Sha is interrogated to reveal Noire's whereabouts. Noire surrenders to save her friend, though Uni soon arrives and breaks Noire out of jail.

At the tower, K-Sha reveals the truth that she is Lastation's Gold Third member and is also in love with Noire. Noire takes Uni's place in the dual to spare Uni and wins, sparing K-Sha, resulting in the two agreeing to be friends. Later, the tower is attacked by The Order, hoping to cut off K-Sha's power source; the crystal on the top floor. The three defeat the order but Uni is poisoned by a chemical weapon.

C-Sha is approached by a politician named Azna=Leb and tasked with assassinating Blanc, but she refuses. After reuniting with Rom and Ram on a rescue mission, Blanc is approached by Azna=Leb and tasked with investigating C-Sha following troubling allegations against her. Blanc questions her friend and C-Sha apologetically reveals the truth, that she is the Gold Third leader of Lowee and is the source of the monster outbreak as her powers randomly release an uncontrollable red mist which summons monsters against her will.\n","\n","C-Sha is arrested by Azna=Leb's agents despite Blanc's protests of her innocence. C-Sha is sentenced to execution but releases the red mist which summons an army of delusionary monsters to attack Lowee, allowing her to escape with help from her friend Financier.

After noticing an incoming monster hoard which Neptune recognizes from Zero Dimension, she stops their advance by destroying the passageway with an explosive. Suddenly, Uzume appears and summons Dark Purple, who then abducts the four CPUs. Nepgear and Uni witness the event and return to Histoire to plan a rescue mission. Histoire reveals that the CPUs were taken to the Zero Dimension but the party should be able to follow by using the Dreamcast since the passageway was destroyed earlier. After sparring with Nepgear, Uni, Ram, Rom, Compa and IF, the four members of Gold Third agree to join the rescue mission.\n","\n","In Zero Dimension, the party interrogate Uzume who denies any knowledge of abducting the CPUs and joins the party to aid in the investigation. Umio reports an anomaly to the northeast where the party find Uzume's doppelganger who reveals her plan to fuse the Zero Dimension and the Hyper Dimension (Neptune's reality) by using her four golden towers as an anchor point, which would plunge the new world into ruin and despair. She then escapes to a third dimension; Heart Dimension, by opening a portal. The party follow her through the portal where they find a fragmented world made from memories and dreams.

The doppelganger, who older Neptune refers to a 'Kurome', ordered Arfoire to kill her after learning the truth. With older Neptune back in the party, the group explores Heart Dimension and learn that Kurome has the power to induce both nightmares and false happiness, which she is using to corrupt the CPUs like she did previously to Affimojas and Gold Third. She also partially re-wrote the timeline to make the public forget, and thus weaken, the CPUs, but newly acquired Shares are cancelling its effects. The party witness the CPUs' fantasies; with Neptune wanting praise and her nation's happiness, Noire wanting to be a successful voice-actress and socialite, Blanc wanting large breasts and Vert wanting younger sisters who are actually clones of herself.\n","\n","The party track down Kurome, who reveals she is a spirit of the real Uzume; an old CPU of Planeptune who volunteered to be sealed in Heart Dimension by Histoire after unintentionally harming her people having failed to control her powers. There, she came to resent humankind who shunned her and became a wandering spirit, whilst a fragment of her power; her conscience, took on a new life in the connected Zero Dimension, as the new Uzume. Kurome then unleashes the corrupted CPUs on the party who attempt to kill their own sisters but, after an intense battle, Uzume succeeds in cancelling out Kurome's mind-controlling negative energy with Share energy. Kurome reveals that Uzume's growing power also increases her own, allowing her to physically manifest in the Hyper Dimension, leaving the party to battle her latest giant; Dark Green, who they successfully manage to destroy, along with several CPU clones.\n","\n","A flashback reveals that Umio is a reincarnation of the old Uzume's lover, though he retains no memories of this.

Croire intervenes and summons Dark White to destroy the CPUs, though the party emerges victorious and re-captures Croire. The Hyper Dimension party are attacked by Kurome in an attempt to seize the Dreamcast, which she reveals contains another fragment of Uzume's soul, though the party defeat Kurome's Dark Black CPU and chase Kurome back to the Heart Dimension.

The party successfully destroy Dark Orange in the Sharing Field, though Kurome orders her monsters to destroy Hyper Dimension before disappearing. With Hyper Dimension facing annihilation, Uzume orders Nepgear and Neptune to destroy the original Share Crystal, which will erase herself, Kurome, Zero/Heart Dimension and the monster hoard.

With Cherbourg, Iron Base would be able to adequately defend itself against attacks and rebuild Iron Town, so Po-M tasks Talis with recovering Cherbourg's components so that they may complete it.\n","\n","As they begin the search, they encounter an enormous SoN that Talis recognizes as the one that killed his mother and destroyed his home town. In a blind fury, he attacks it, but is defeated by a massive blast from the SoN and is brought back to Iron Base. Po-M nicknames the SoN \"Catastropus\" and identifies it as the one responsible for the destruction of the other settlements in Distokio, but warns that it is too powerful for Talis to confront at his current strength. Talis, frustrated, asks if there is anything to help him get stronger, to which Po-M has a possible solution in the form of Nephilim Technology: SoNs technology that was recovered and reverse-engineered by U-Tokio before its destruction, far more powerful than conventional weapons. Cherbourg is also NephTech, so she gives Talis a device that can detect its pieces, along with other components of NephTech weaponry to assist him in battle.\n","\n","While searching U-Tokio's tunnels for components of Cherbourg, Talis discovers a girl with a tail floating in a preservation chamber. Upon waking, the girl, named Ittica, goes with Talis back to Iron Base, and later reveals that she is a genetically-engineered human-animal hybrid called a \"Mute\" which possesses the ability to shapeshift. Once all the components to Cherbourg are gathered, the team returns to base to assemble it. Toni confesses her feelings for Talis, but Talis turns her away, stating that he is aware of Yokky's feelings for Toni and does not want to hurt him, and reveals to her the extent of his body's conversion by the nanobots, stating that he does not have much time left. Yokky hears the conversation and, realizing Toni is in love with Talis, becomes conflicted about his self-confidence.\n","\n","Cherbourg is assembled, and successfully tested, but the test attracts the attention of the SoNs. Realizing that the SoNs are now aware of Iron Base's power, they track the source of the attacks to an abandoned military fortress formerly used by U-Tokio, now being used as a staging point and resource stockpile by the SoNs; after finding evidence of the Catastropus, they realize it has set its sights on the upgraded Iron Base. After shutting the fortress down to prevent the SoNs from using it, they return to Iron Base to prepare their next move. Yokky and Toni, with the assistance of Maria and Ittica respectively, come to terms with their feelings and insecurity, and the citizens of Iron Base steel themselves in preparation for the final battle.\n","\n","Aware that Catastropus is now en route, the team forms a plan: With Cherbourg in place, the Catastropus will be preoccupied attempting to break through it, and will leave itself unguarded for a close-range attack carried out by Talis and his team. With his team, Talis breaks through the Catastropus' vanguard and destroys the Catastropus itself, avenging his family and the people of Dystokio. Following the battle, Talis makes preparations to leave and seek out more survivors. Yokky joins him, and after getting a farewell from the citizens of Iron Base and a promise that they will always be a home for them to return to, the two depart in the tank Talis originally arrived in.\n","\n","After the credits, Talis and Yokky encounter Toni, who wishes to join them. After a moment of consideration, Talis smiles, and accepts her into the team.\n","\n","After the game, the player has the option of starting a New Game Plus in two different modes: Story Mode, which replays the story with all player progression and items but locking certain plot-related vehicles and equipment, and Hunter Mode, which allows the player to start with all progression, vehicles, and equipment while minimizing the story, allowing the player to focus on hunting monsters and collecting bounties.\n","\n","\n","Gameplay[edit]\n","\n","Metro 2033 is a first-person shooter video game.[1] It is predominantly set within the tunnels of the Moscow Metro, though some sections take place on the surface, in the ruins of Moscow.[2] The story is told through a linear single-player campaign,[3] and important plot moments are shown during cutscenes.[4]\n","\n","The human and mutant enemies can be killed with a variety of firearms. The game features traditional guns like a revolver, assault rifles and shotguns, as well as more inventive weapons like a pneumatic crossbow.[5] In firefights, human enemies take cover and flank the player, while mutant enemies stay in the open and try to bite them.[6] Alternatively, the player can employ stealth to evade their enemies or kill them silently.[7] This can be achieved by using a throwing knife to kill an enemy from afar, or shooting an enemy with a suppressed weapon.[8] The player can recover health by waiting for it to regenerate, or by using a med-kit to heal themselves immediately.[3] The game features a minimalistic heads-up display (HUD). Gameplay information is presented to the player via audio and visual cues. For instance, players must inspect their weapons to see if they are about to run out of ammunition and therefore have to reload.[9]\n","\n","Since the game has a large survival horror focus, the player often has little ammunition, and must scavenge for supplies from caches or dead bodies.[3] An essential supply is pre-war 5.45×39mm ammunition (referred to in the game as \"military grade ammunition\"), which is also the main currency in the tunnels.[3] This ammunition can be traded for weapons and upgrades, or used directly as stronger bullets than other scavenged ammunition.[10][11] As most of the tunnels feature little to no light, the player can use a flashlight to explore dark areas.[3] However, the flashlight needs to be charged with a battery charger in order to stay effective.[12] The player must also use a gas mask to explore areas affected by radiation, both underground and on the surface.[8] The gas mask can be damaged in combat, which forces the player to find a replacement.[6] The player's survival also depends on constantly replacing their air filter,[13] which they can monitor by inspecting Artyom's wristwatch.[12]\n","\n","Throughout the game, there are certain moral choices that can be made. If the player is compassionate to the people living in the tunnels, such as giving the homeless some military grade ammunition, they may be able to watch a different cutscene at the end of the game. These moral choices are never explicitly mentioned, and it is possible to play through the game without knowing of their presence.[14]\n","\n","\n","None\n","Gameplay[edit]\n","\n","Metroid Dread is an action-adventure game in which players control bounty hunter Samus Aran as she explores the planet ZDR. It retains the side-scrolling gameplay of previous Metroid games, alongside the free aim and melee attacks added in Samus Returns (2017). As the player explores, they discover new items and weapons, allowing them to access new areas.[2]\n","\n","Dread adds stealth elements, with Samus avoiding the EMMI robots in certain areas by hiding, reducing her noise, and using the Phantom Cloak, camouflage that makes her invisible but slows her movement. If an EMMI catches Samus, the player has two brief chances to perform melee counters and escape. If they fail, Samus is killed. EMMIs can only be destroyed when Samus obtains the temporary \"Omega Blaster\" upgrade, which is lost upon using it to destroy one; however, destroying an EMMI grants Samus a new permanent upgrade.[2] Upgrades can also be found by finding Chozo statues or destroying a Core-X like in previous games. Players unlock images in an in-game gallery based on their completion time, difficulty level, and percentage of items collected.[3]\n","\n","Plot[edit]\n","\n","The Galactic Federation receives evidence that the X, a dangerous species of parasite that can mimic any creature it infects, survives on the remote planet ZDR.

The Federation sends Samus Aran to ZDR to investigate.\n","\n","Underground, Samus encounters a Chozo warrior, who destroys the exit, defeats her in combat and strips her suit of most of its abilities. Her ship's computer, Adam, instructs her to find another path to the surface and return to her ship. Samus is attacked by the EMMI, which have been reprogrammed. She escapes and absorbs a mysterious energy from one of the planet's central units. The energy temporarily enables the Omega Blaster, with which she destroys the EMMI and regains some of her abilities.\n","\n","In Ferenia, Samus is captured by another EMMI, but is saved by a Chozo named Quiet Robe, who deactivates them. Quiet Robe explains that, long ago, two Chozo tribes, the scientific Thoha and warrior Mawkin, banded together to trap the Metroids on the planet SR388. The Thoha intended to destroy SR388, but Raven Beak, the Mawkin leader, wanted to use the Metroids as a bioweapon to conquer the galaxy. He slaughtered the Thoha tribe and spared Quiet Robe so the Metroids could be controlled with his Thoha DNA. He planned to use ZDR to house Metroids, but had to contain an infestation of the X while Samus eradicated the Metroids from SR388. Raven Beak reprogrammed the EMMI robots and lured Samus to ZDR to extract the Metroid DNA implanted in her during the events of Fusion, which would allow him to revive the Metroids.\n","\n","Quiet Robe opens a barrier to allow Samus to progress before he is assassinated by one of Raven Beak's robotic soldiers. Adam encourages Samus to defeat Raven Beak and destroy ZDR. In Elun, Samus encounters the X parasites and inadvertently releases them into the rest of the planet. One of the X possesses Quiet Robe's corpse and reactivates the remaining EMMI. Samus arrives on the surface, where she is attacked by the last of the EMMI. She destroys it by sapping its energy with her hand, a power gained from her Metroid DNA. As a side effect, Samus is slowly becoming a Metroid.\n","\n","On the floating fortress of Itorash, Samus confronts Raven Beak, who has been masquerading as Adam. Raven Beak reveals that he spared her before so that she would awaken her Metroid powers, at which point he would clone her to create an army of the most powerful Metroid of all. Samus battles Raven Beak and is nearly killed, but the Metroid abilities within her grant her incredible power. Samus attacks Raven Beak, draining energy from Itorash and causing it to crash into ZDR. Raven Beak is infected by an X, and Samus uses her newfound powers to destroy him. Samus retreats to her ship as ZDR begins to self-destruct, but is unable to use it due to her energy-draining Metroid powers. The X possessing Quiet Robe appears and allows itself to be absorbed into Samus to neutralize her Metroid abilities, allowing her to escape the planet before it explodes.\n","\n","\n","None\n","Gameplay[edit]\n","\n","Metroid Prime is a 3D action-adventure game in which players control series protagonist Samus Aran from a first-person perspective, unlike previous games of the Metroid series,[9][10] with third-person elements used for Morph Ball mode.[9] The gameplay involves solving puzzles to reveal secrets, platform jumping, and shooting foes with the help of a \"lock-on\" mechanism that allows circle strafing while staying aimed at the enemy.[9][10]\n","\n","Samus must travel through the world of Tallon IV searching for twelve Chozo Artifacts that will open the path to the Phazon meteor impact crater, while collecting power-ups that let her reach new areas. The Varia Suit, for example, protects Samus' armor against high temperatures, allowing her to enter volcanic regions. Some items are obtained after boss fights. Items must be collected in a specific order; for example, players cannot access certain areas until they find a certain Beam to open doors, or discover new ordnance with which to beat bosses.[11][12] Players are incentivized to explore to find upgrades such as ammunition packs and extra health.[13]\n","\n","The heads-up display, which simulates the inside of Samus' helmet, features a radar display, a map, ammunition for missiles, a health meter, a danger meter for negotiating hazardous landscape or materials, and a health bar and name display for bosses.

Along with the ability to jump and shoot, Patricia has the ability to push in and out blocks dotted around the stage with her \"Siren Helmet\", using them as platforms or a means to destroy certain enemies. There are also various other types of blocks such as launcher blocks that send Patricia or an enemy in a certain direction and colored blocks that allow the player to change which plane they switch on. During each level, the player has three hearts (called her \"Heart Drive\", in universe),[8] with the player losing one heart if Patricia is hurt by an enemy, comes into contact with spikes or is pushed into the screen by a block change (Checkpoints created allow Patricia to respawn at that point in the case of the latter two).

The protagonist chooses a character class and is sent on a journey to stop the Dark Lord. Along their journey, the player creates more companions, meets the Great Sage, and reaches Greenhorne castle, continuing the quest after the Dark Lord steals the faces of the King and the Princess. Afterwards, the team enters the kingdom of Neksdor, only to be attacked by the Dark Lord, who steals the protagonist's companions and renders the protagonist without a class. After the guardian provides the hero with new powers, they head out through Neksdor, meeting three new companions and the Genie of the Lamp. The team continues to the Realm of the Fey, where the Dark Lord attacks again, stealing the hero's companions and their character class again, prompting the guardian to provide a new group of character classes. The hero is tasked with saving the three Fab Fairies of the Realm, who provide the team the way to the Dark Lord's castle in Karkaton. Before they can open the door, the Fab Fairies have their faces stolen by the Dark Lord. After retrieving their faces, the Fab Fairies open the door to Karkaton, and the team head out.

The core gameplay revolves around picking up and placing these objects. These blocks are arranged in a 3D grid, while players can move freely around the world. Players can \"mine\" blocks and then place them elsewhere, enabling them to build things.[21] Many commentators have described the game's physics system as unrealistic.[22] The game also contains a material called redstone, which can be used to make primitive mechanical devices, electrical circuits, and logic gates, allowing for the construction of many complex systems.[23]\n","\n","The game world is virtually infinite and procedurally generated as players explore it, using a map seed that is obtained from the system clock at the time of world creation (or manually specified by the player).[24][25][26] There are limits on vertical movement, but Minecraft allows an infinitely large game world to be generated on the horizontal plane. Due to technical issues when extremely distant locations are reached, however, there is a barrier preventing players from traversing to locations beyond 30 million blocks from the center.[i][obsolete source] The game achieves this by splitting the world data into smaller 16 by 16 sections called \"chunks\" that are only created or loaded when players are nearby.[24] The world is divided into biomes ranging from deserts to jungles to snowfields;[27][28] the terrain includes plains, mountains, forests, caves, and bodies of water or lava.[26] The in-game time system follows a day and night cycle, with one full cycle lasting for 20 real-time minutes.\n","\n","When starting a new world, players must choose one of five game modes, as well as one of four difficulties, ranging from \"Peaceful\" to \"Hard\". Increasing the difficulty of the game causes the player to take more damage from mobs, as well as having other difficulty-specific effects. For example, the Peaceful difficulty prevents hostile mobs from spawning, and the Hard difficulty allows players to starve to death if their hunger bar is depleted.[29] Once selected, the difficulty can be changed, but the game mode is locked and can only be changed with cheats.\n","\n","New players are given a randomly selected default character skin out of 9 possibilities, including Steve or Alex,[30] but the option to create custom skins was made available in 2010.[31] Players encounter various non-player characters known as mobs, such as animals, villagers, and hostile creatures.[32] Passive mobs, such as cows, pigs, and chickens, can be hunted for food and crafting materials. They spawn in the daytime, while hostile mobs—including large spiders, skeletons, and zombies—spawn during nighttime or in dark places such as caves.[26] Some hostile mobs, such as zombies, skeletons and drowned (underwater versions of zombies), burn under the sun if they have no headgear.[33] Other creatures unique to Minecraft include the creeper (an exploding creature that sneaks up on the player) and the enderman (a creature with the ability to teleport as well as pick up and place blocks).[34] There are also variants of mobs that spawn in different conditions; for example, zombies have husk and drowned variants that spawn in deserts and oceans, respectively.[35]\n","\n","Minecraft has two alternative dimensions besides the Overworld (the main world): the Nether and the End.[34] The Nether is a hell-like underworld dimension accessed via player-built obsidian portals; it contains many unique resources and can be used to travel great distances in the Overworld, due to every block traveled in the Nether being equivalent to 8 blocks traveled in the Overworld.[36] Water cannot exist in the Nether, as it will vaporize instantly.[37] The Nether is mainly populated by pigman-like mobs called piglins and their zombified counterparts, plus floating balloon-like mobs called ghasts.[38] The player can also build an optional boss mob called The Wither out of materials found in the Nether.[39]\n","\n","The End is reached by underground portals in the Overworld. It consists of islands floating above a dark, bottomless void.

With the sword now completely useless, the player flushes the broken sword down the toilet in the now destroyed factory and returns home to get some rest.\n","\n","In the second run, the player encounters the broken sword and re-activates the curse, but now the player is limited to one hit point, has less range, and the time limit is now 40 seconds (possibly due to the sword being broken). Upon doing everything again, the player flushes the sword once again, this time for good.\n","\n","In a post-credits scene, the player is relaxing on a remote island until almost all of the characters encountered suddenly appear.\n","\n","Gameplay[edit]\n","\n","The gameplay of Minit consists of sixty-second lives in which the player attempts to uncover mysteries and lift a curse.[6] Gameplay progresses by the player keeping all items they have collected during each of their sixty-second lives. Where they respawn depends on their last save point, one for every location excluding the factory. The combat is a simple stab in the direction of movement, but extra abilities can be unlocked by certain items (the Gardening Glove allows the player to break trees).\n","\n","The game consists of three modes. Normal mode has the standard rules and the 60-second timer. Second Run can be played after Normal mode with added difficulties, restrictions, and a 40-second timer.

The dragon immediately transforms into a humanoid girl in a maid outfit and introduces herself as Tohru. It turns out, that during a drunken excursion into the mountains the night before, Kobayashi had encountered the dragon, who claimed to have come from another world. Subsequently, Kobayashi removed a holy sword from Tohru's back, earning her gratitude. With Tohru having no place to stay, Kobayashi offers to let the dragon stay at her home and become her personal maid, to which she agrees, having fallen in love with Kobayashi.\n","\n","Despite being efficient at housework, Tohru proves an unorthodox character, occasionally scaring Kobayashi and often bringing more trouble to Kobayashi's life than help. Additionally, Tohru's presence alone attracts other dragons, gods, and mythical beings to her new home. One of these dragons, Kanna, shows up at Kobayashi's door, demanding that Kobayashi return Tohru to the other world. It is then revealed that she'd been exiled from the other world, and having nowhere else to stay, Kobayashi takes her in and becomes her guardian. As both Tohru and Kanna settle into the human world, Kobayashi starts to think of them as family.\n","\n","\n","None\n","None\n","Gameplay[edit]\n","\n","Moero Crystal is the direct sequel to 2014's Moe Chronicle, and contains the same ecchi-focused gameplay as its predecessor.[5] Whereas in Chronicle players were on a journey searching for panties, in Crystal, they search for bras.[6] Crystal also expands on the previous gameplay, with its \"build up, release, and insert\" battle system featuring a new \"Insert\" command, allowing players to change the characters' attacking order.[7] During battles, the player will also get to help the monster girls by providing them with buffs as support.[8] This is as the protagonist, Zenox, cannot attack and can only utilize support abilities. A team of five monster girls is required for battle.[7] Buffs and bonuses can be utilized and the girls' costumes degrade over time.[7] Upon defeating a monster girl, players can recruit them through the game's touchscreen \"scratching\" feature;[7] a new \"Double Scratch\" mode allows players to \"massage\" and interact with up to two monster girls at a time.[8]\n","\n","50 monster girls from the previous game reappear, as well as 30 additional new ones. Crystal also features different endings specific to different monster girls,[6] with each of the 80 girls having a separate ending.[9] Upon meeting certain prerequisites, it is possible to go inside the heart of a specific monster girl in a dungeon called the \"Depths Domain\"; clearing it unlocks a variety of different things for the said character. Unlike Moero Chronicle, where character costumes of bras and panties came in a set, Crystal allows players to mix and match thus creating different costume combinations.[10] Additionally, players can visit monster girls to gift them presents, as well as visit the in-game inn.[10]\n","\n","The game's story begins when the \"Bra of Everlasting Darkness\" and \"Panties of Hope\" are stolen, and a \"Dimensional Chasm\" appears in the skies.[6] The world starts rising and pulls itself towards the rift. The protagonist is a \"lucky lecher\" named Zenox; Otton, a panty hunter and mascot of the series reappears from the previous games,[6] and the game follows the characters as they search and gather monster girl bras in order to \"save the world\".[11]\n","\n","\n","Gameplay[edit]\n","\n","The game features the player as a young boy looking for his video game console (which heavily resembles a Nintendo DS), which was hidden by his mother. The game console is found by solving puzzles, such as moving items to certain spots to be able to reach the console.\n","\n","In the Nintendo Switch release, a mode involving a man swinging around a pole was added. The minigame is presumably a reference to hap inc's older game Crazy Horizontal bar.\n","\n","\n","None\n","None\n","Gameplay[edit]\n","\n","Monark is a tactical role-playing game with combat similar to Lost Dimension.

While trying to stop Nabu, Jin gets turned into a pig. Learning from the king's court magician, Mysticat, about a way to return everyone to normal, Jin goes on a quest to recover five animal orbs from across the kingdom. Upon doing so, however, Mysticat takes the orbs from Jin and uses them to open the gateway to the Dark Realm for his master Lord Xaros, who had been manipulating Nabu to do his bidding. Venturing into the Dark Realm, Jin confronts Xaros and, with the help of his friends and the spirits of past Wonder Boys, manages to defeat him, restoring the kingdom to normal.\n","\n","Gameplay[edit]\n","\n","Monster Boy and the Cursed Kingdom is a side-scrolling adventure game in which players control Jin as he battles enemies and solves puzzles to progress through the story. Similar to the 1989 Sega Master System game, Wonder Boy III: The Dragon's Trap, Jin gains five different animal forms throughout the course of the game, which can be switched between at will once obtained. These include a pig who can sniff out hidden contraptions and clues; a snake who can spit venom, climb walls and enter small spaces; a frog who can swim, use his tongue to swing on hoops and carry items; a lion who can dash and break through blocks; and a dragon who can fly and spit fire projectiles. Jin's human form can warp and pass through obstacles. In addition to these forms, players can obtain weapons and armor from shops, many of which offer unique abilities and can be upgraded by finding gemstones. There are also various magic spells that can be used by Jin in either his human or pig forms. Defeated enemies may drop coins, hearts or magic resourcers.[1]\n","\n","Exploration works similarly to \"Metroidvania\" titles, where the player goes through interconnected areas that require certain abilities in order to be accessed. Over the course of the game, the player gains access to fast travel teleporters that allows to quickly move from one area to the other. Exploration often rewards players with magic upgrades, health point increases and also pieces of the legendary golden armor, which upon collected can be forged by a blacksmith.\n","\n","The game uses an auto-save system upon going through the save altars, which come in two variations: the normal save altar, and the angel save altar, which fully recovers Jin's health. Dying has no penalty, and the player will return to the last checkpoint without losing any progress; any items and coins obtained will be retained.\n","\n","The game also features a map which provides information about various areas, and also shows places where the player is supposed to go at the current time. The map develops and adds new images as the player moves through the game.\n","\n","\n","Gameplay[edit]\n","\n","Monster Hunter Generations features gameplay similar to past titles in the series. The player assumes the role of a hunter who embarks on quests to hunt dangerous creatures. A hunter's abilities are determined by the type of armor and weapons that they wear on a quest, as the hunter otherwise has no intrinsic attributes that affect gameplay. All fourteen weapon types from Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate, ranging from swords, hammers, bows, guns, and lances, are included in Monster Hunter Generations, in addition to the new Prowler mode which allows the player to take the role of a Felyne, a sentient cat-like species.[2][3] Each weapon has different sets of moves and abilities that can be employed while in the field.  Armors grant defensive bonuses to physical and elemental damage and can boost specific skills and attack types through base attributes and the addition of special decoration gems and talismans. To make a more powerful hunter that can survive against more dangerous creatures, the player takes materials carved from monsters (either slain or captured via traps), as well as materials gathered from the various fields and purchased in village stores, to craft new armor or to craft and upgrade weapons. Defeating more powerful creatures enables even more potent equipment to be crafted, thus creating a gameplay progress through the game's loot system. New in Generations is the ability to transform armor pieces into new gear similar to weapon upgrade paths by upgrading it with materials from broad categories, like bones or ores, and having the ability to upgrade a weapon directly to a more advanced version without the intermediate upgrade steps.[4]\n","\n","Monster Hunter Generations features new special moves known as Hunting Arts. These moves require the player to wait for the moves to charge up during the course of a hunt before they can be activated. Once ready, the player can activate them at any time, after which they have to wait for them to charge up again before a second use. The Arts have different effects such as dealing massive damage, providing buffs, or healing allies.[2][5] The game also introduces a system called \"Hunting Styles\".[6] This system adds different attack styles for a weapon. Each weapon type in the game will have four distinct forms.[2][6] The Guild Style is a balanced and basic style akin to combat in previous games of the series. The Striker Style is less technical but emphasises the use of Hunting Arts letting the player set up three special attacks. The Aerial Style specialises in mid-air attacks allowing players to use monsters as a platform which they can propel themselves off. The Adept Style gives players an opportunity to perform powerful counterattacks after successfully evading a monster's attack.[7] Visually, the game's combat has been described as flashier than previous titles.[8]\n","\n","The game will have four new signature monsters along with a number of past flagship monsters.[2][9] Included are what are known as Deviant Monsters, previous monsters from other games in the series that have been said to have mutated and evolved into more powerful forms, which on defeat will yield spoils of combat that can be used to craft high-level equipment.[10] The game features four villages which are non-combat areas for getting quests and communicating with non-player characters.[11] Three villages return from previous titles,[11] and a new village called Bherna has been added.[6] The game includes an improved resource gathering system; resource points on the various areas will have more items that can be acquired before they are exhausted and the player only has to hold down a controller button to continue to collect items instead of pressing the button each time, and once per mission, the player can call a Felyne messenger to take one inventory's worth of goods back to a village to store.[12]\n","\n","\n","Gameplay[edit]\n","\n","As with previous Monster Hunter titles, Monster Hunter Rise has the player take the role of a Hunter, tasked with slaying or capturing large monsters using a variety of weapons, tools, and environmental features to damage and weaken them while surviving their attacks. Successful completion of the offered quests provides loot, typically in the form of various monster parts from the monster, which are used to forge new armor and weapons that can be used to take on more powerful monsters, forming the series' notable core loop. Several of the series' monsters return along with a host of new monsters developed for Rise.[1] All fourteen weapon types that have been present in both Monster Hunter Generations and World, which mix archetypes of swords, shields, staves, bows, and guns, are present in Rise.[2]\n","\n","Rise uses the same seamless map approach introduced in Monster Hunter: World unlike the zoned areas typical of earlier games in the series. Its maps are more focused on vertical movement than previous games, as implied by its title, so new tools are given to the player to help with quick vertical scaling. The Wirebug, similar to the Clutch Claw added in Monster Hunter World: Iceborne, allows a player to grapple and swing across gaps or to higher locations as needed.[1] The Wirebug also has different interactions with each weapon type, adding to that weapon's set of moves and combos.[2] Further, the Wirebug allows a player to engage certain monsters in Wyvern Riding, letting the hunter mount and control the creature to a limited degree as to either lead it into areas more amenable for combat or to engage in combat with a different monster.[3]\n","\n","Palamutes are new dog-like companion creatures in Rise. The player can ride them to quickly navigate the map without losing stamina. Additionally, Palamutes can quickly scale cliffs and perform attacks while fighting monsters alongside the player's other companion option, the cat-like Palicoes, who return from previous games.\n","\n","Rise features both single player and local and online multiplayer modes with up to four hunters in a group. In single player modes, the player hunts with up to two of any combination of the Palico or Palamute companions. In the online modes, players selects up to one of either the Palico or Palamute to join them.[1]\n","\n","In addition to the series' typical hunts, Rise introduces Rampage, a tower defense mode where the players must defend the base village from several attacking monsters. Prior to and during the attack, the players can set up siege weapons and instruct non-player characters to attack the monsters while the players attack the monsters directly.[4]\n","\n","Besides incorporation of new content such as new monsters and locales, the expansion Sunbreak adds in a Switch Skills Swap feature that allows the player to switch between two different skill sets while in the middle of a hunt without returning to a base camp. Current non-player characters in the hunting hubs can be befriended by the hunter character and then become companions that join the player for hunts.[5]\n","\n","Plot[edit]\n","\n","\n","None\n","None\n","Games[edit]\n","\n","\n","Games[edit]\n","\n","\n","None\n","Gameplay[edit]\n","\n","Although it is possible to acquire a monster in-game, the series is known for the ability to acquire new monsters using Compact Discs (CDs). Players can use any readable CD, and the game creates a monster using the CD's metadata.[6] Certain CDs would result in unique monsters: for example, Tecmo's Deception gives the player Ardebaran, a villain from that game,[7] and some Christmas music albums will give the player a monster of type \"Santa\".  The Windows, Switch, and Android/iOS versions retain the basic gameplay and content of the original, but do not support CD playback; the monsters-from-CD feature is emulated by allowing players to look up CDs from a custom database.[8]\n","\n","Once the player has two or more monsters in reserve, they can be combined, creating a new monster with traits of both 'parents'. There are twelve basic types of monsters that can be combined, as well as eight special types players can receive as rewards by completing tasks or inserting a CD into the PlayStation.[9] The common types are Dinos, Golems, Suezos, Hares, Tigers, Galis, Monols, Worms, Nagas, Jells, Pixies, and Plants. The rare types are Dragons, Magics, Apes, Ghosts, Hengers, Doodles, Nyas, and Disks. Monsters can be combined to create a new monster with a main type and a sub-type which are determined randomly.\n","\n","The monsters can then be raised to fight other monsters. There are six stats that determine how the monster does in battle: Power fuels physical attacks, Intelligence fuels and defends against energy attacks, Life determines monster's hit points, Skill affects accuracy, Speed helps evade opponents' attacks, and Defense reduces damage received from physical attacks. Monsters train either by doing chores nearby, or can be sent to be trained by experts, where they have the chance to gain new attack techniques. It is possible to increase some of the monster's stats with food or vitamins, but vitamins comes at a price of decreasing one stat as well as shorting the life span dramatically.\n","\n","Currency can be used to purchase items in the game, earned by winning monster fighting tournaments. The game can end if the player runs out of currency to manage the monster.\n","\n","The primary way to advance through the game is through monster fighting tournaments. While in battle, each monster has attacks available to it, some moves are only available at close range, others from a distance. Players cannot control the monster directly in a fight, but can call for their monster to stay away or close in, and attack with whichever move is available at the current range.\n","\n","In Monster Rancher 2 and Monster Rancher Advance 2, Holly, the assistant from this game, cameos as a rancher from the group, AGIMA, for whom the player trains monsters.\n","\n","\n","Gameplay[edit]\n","\n","This game involves raising, fighting, and breeding monsters. The main character is never seen on screen and never talks to anyone directly. Instead, all of the dialog and action is done by the trainer's assistant Colt and her toucan Joy. The player chooses their actions and choices through menu options.\n","\n","Tournaments, from which money, items, and fame can be earned, are held throughout the year. However, only by winning an IMa Official Cup, four of which are held each year, can breeders and monsters earn higher ranks. As a monster's rank increases, it gains access to higher level tournaments.\n","\n","Monsters begin life knowing a small number of moves that can be used in battle, with more learned through training. To perform a move, a monster must expend some “guts,” which regenerate constantly during battle. Each move can only be performed while within a particular range of an opponent, and from close range monsters can knock opponents back.\n","\n","Besides the monster types the player can unlock from the beginning, there are many more which the player can raise. There are three different ways in which to unlock new monster types for raising: plot events, expedition, and errantry. The most common way these new monsters are given to the player is by the gain of an item, which when used to combine monsters, will produce this new type. After that happens, CDs will now be allowed to produce monsters of that type.\n","\n","\n","None\n","None\n","Gameplay[edit]\n","\n","A co-op, roguelike action role-playing game that is described by the developer as a \"personality test RPG\",[1] Moon Hunters lets up to four players choose from one of six different characters, each with their own strengths and weaknesses.[2] They must set out on a dangerous journey to bring the moon back to the fantasy land of Issaria and stop the evil Sun Cult.[2] The game's endings can differ widely depending on the choices the characters make during the journey, and the outcome of the final battle.[2] The areas of the game are procedurally generated and will differ for each playthrough.[2] However, information about past playthroughs is saved in the form of constellations.[2]\n","\n","Plot[edit]\n","\n","One night in the fantasy land of Issaria, the moon does not rise.[3] As the source of all magic and spiritual power, its disappearance imbalanced the world, and the game's heroes must set out to restore the balance again.[3] Without the moon's power, monsters infest the land, causing chaos and spreading danger.[3]\n","\n","The story of the game is non-linear, and changes depending on the actions of players all the way up to and including the ending.[3]\n","\n","\n","Gameplay[edit]\n","\n","Moonlighter has the player manage their shop during the day and go exploring at night.

Alongside the returning Fatalities, Brutalities, Stage Fatalities, Friendships and Quitalities, new gameplay features are introduced, such as Fatal Blows and Krushing Blows. Fatal Blows are special moves similar to the X-ray moves in the 2011 reboot and Mortal Kombat X. Like X-ray moves, Fatal Blows deal a large amount of damage, but unlike them, they only become available when a player's health drops below 30%, and can only be performed once per match. Krushing Blows are a special cinematic variation of a given special move, triggered when certain requirements are met, like most Brutalities in the previous game.[11] Also new to the series is a Flawless Block mechanic, which allows for a comeback window after blocking an attack with precise timing.[12] Another returning finisher is Mercy, last seen in Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3, where the winning player can opt to revive their opponent after the \"Finish Him/Her\" prompt, causing the opponent to gain a small amount of life.\n","\n","Mortal Kombat 11 introduces a Custom Variation feature which offers a character customization system similar to the Gear system in NetherRealm Studios' previous DC Comics fighting game Injustice 2, improving over the Variation system featured in Mortal Kombat X.

The five game modes include: Drill Land World Tour, which has the standard Mr. Driller gameplay,[3] The Hole of Druaga, a parody of Namco's own The Tower of Druaga where the player needs to retrieve a key to open a door,[3] Horror Night House, where the player needs to inject ghost-filled blocks with Holy water,[3] Drindy Adventure, which features traps such as rolling boulders and spikes,[3] and Star Driller, based on the Space Stage in Mr. Driller G featuring flashing \"Star Blocks\" that disappear after a brief moment.[5]\n","\n","Alongside the five attractions, the player can visit a night-time parade featuring many of the game's characters marching.[6] Completing any of the game's attractions will award currency, which can be used in a gift shop to purchase power-ups, souvenirs and trading cards with the characters printed on them.[6] The game features support for the GameCube - Game Boy Advance link cable peripheral, which allows the player to import their \"Pacteria\" digital pets from Mr. Driller A into the game's parade or purchase exclusive power-up items.[6]\n","\n","\n","Gameplay[edit]\n","\n","Mr. Shifty is experienced from a top-down perspective. The player assumes the role of a thief, Mr. Shifty, who is attempting to steal a plutonium core from a building secured by many enemy guards. Shifty advances through a linear series of rooms to reach the end of the stage, which is an elevator on all but the last stage. He must either defeat all the enemies in a room to unlock the door to the next, or travel to its exit while avoiding all its hazards.\n","\n","Shifty's signature ability is \"shifting\", which teleports him a few meters and lets him pass through thin walls or dodge bullets. Shifting is limited: one shift regenerates for every second the player does not shift, but if the meter is depleted by shifting five times without allowing a recharge, the player cannot shift for five seconds. Some rooms have \"shift blockers\" that cannot be shifted into or out of. The player can punch to kill enemies in two or three hits, depending on the enemy. Scattered around levels are various melee weapons and items which kill enemies in one hit; these items may be held or thrown, and break after a few uses (except for certain throwable items).[1]\n","\n","Enemies carry many different weapons, including shotguns, flamethrowers, and rocket launchers. Any hit from a weapon — or from an environmental hazard such as lasers, mines, or turrets — will kill Shifty and send him to the beginning of the room to try again.\n","\n","Killing enemies adds to a meter at the bottom of the player's screen, which begins to drain after not killing an enemy for a short time. When this meter is full, the next bullet that comes close to Shifty will activate \"Slow-Mo\". During Slow-Mo, shift recharges almost instantly and time is slowed down for all enemies.\n","\n","Plot[edit]\n","\n","Silent protagonist Mr. Shifty, in radio contact with his superior Nyx, breaches Olympus Tower, the offices of StoneCorp. They aim to steal a dangerous weapon called the \"mega-plutonium\", to prevent its use for nefarious purposes by the evil Chairman Stone. Shifty infiltrates the building's lower floors and locates the mega-plutonium, but it is a decoy and a bomb. Nyx and Shifty, undaunted, decide to continue by killing Stone, who contacts Shifty by radio. Stone is impressed by Shift's abilities and offers him a job, but Shifty ignores him. At the end of the chapter, Stone sedates Shifty with noxious gas in the elevator, saying Shifty should have accepted his offer.\n","\n","Shifty awakes deep underground in a cell filled with a shift blocker, but punches through the wall to freedom. He fights his way to a computer terminal, where he re-establishes radio contact with Nyx, who guides him to the surface. There, he encounters Stone, who seems to die in a large explosion.\n","\n","Nyx at first intends to extract Shifty, but they encounter Stone again soon after. Nyx, shocked, orders Shifty to kill him, but Stone disappears. He reveals that he has studied Shifty and used the real mega-plutonium as a power source for a machine that can teleport anything everywhere. Shifty battles through the many obstacles and guards that Stone shifts in his way, finally destroying the machine's core. This causes it to go haywire, shifting objects randomly, before it explodes and dies.

Presented in a visual novel style, similar to the Ace Attorney series, players are tasked with questioning witnesses and suspects and investigating areas for clues. Investigating brings up nonogram puzzles, which the player must solve to uncover a piece of evidence, which can then be presented to witnesses to advance the story. These nonogram puzzles are solved similar to many other computer-based nonogram puzzles, giving the player the ability to mark spaces that should be filled and those that should be empty as a method to track their work and make deductions towards solving the puzzle. A player can make any number of mistakes as they progress without penalty in most puzzles, but may ask for hints towards a solution. Some sections will require the player to complete a series of smaller nonogram puzzles within a time limit and without using \"empty space\" markers or hints.\n","\n","The story is split into four cases, each with a Detective Rank that starts at F and increases as the player solves puzzles. Scoring enough points raises the rank and unlocks bonus puzzles outside of the main story, with more points awarded for not using hints.

However, their life force, called Levi-Sense, proved to be poisonous to humans to the point of being named the Miasma; only sparse human settlements were allowed to survive, one of them being the Hoshifuri village, in exchange for the sacrifice of a 15-year-old girl every 200 years. However, the daughter of the royal family, Reco, is apparently the next in line after being given an ornate bracelet by a mysterious boy in Shinju Forest, where she lost herself at a young age: by the day she turns 15, the Miasma contaminates the village. In order to save her people, she enters Shinju Forest once more, riding the golden Koujuu beetle Kiniro (with which the golden bracelet grants a telepathic link) on a quest to meet the Koujuu god himself.\n","\n","\n","Gameplay[edit]\n","\n","In Mushroom Wars 2, players command armies in dynamic short-session matches, capturing buildings of opponents, which requires strategic resource management, fast reflexes, and the ability to oversee up to thousands of units at once.\n","\n","Mushroom Wars 2 features four episodes of story-driven campaign, 50 missions each. A plotless multiplayer mode with custom game option lets players try out new strategies with up to three friends in free-for-all or team-based matches.[6] Skirmish mode also lets players fight against artificial intelligence opponents (computer-controlled).[7]\n","\n","Before the match, players choose one of several hero characters from 4 mushroom tribes: Shrooms - Rudo or Ayner, Proteus - Marty'O or Cree, Shii'Moris - Stella or Trini, Grims - Pahom or Ankh. Each character has different skills attributable to his specific tribe and applicable to a certain territory or certain buildings.[8] Special abilities bar is filled by the souls of soldiers who die in battles, so the more player fights, the faster he can open one of four unique skills of his character.\n","\n","There are three types of buildings: villages that produce units, towers that defend a certain radius of territory and forges that create weapons to make the army stronger. Villages can be upgraded three times - the higher the level of upgrade, the more units they fit in and produce troopers faster. Towers can also be upgraded three times, each time increasing their effective radius and rate of attacks. Forges cannot be upgraded. Buildings can be converted into buildings of other types and back.\n","\n","Players expand their influence on the map by growing armies in the base villages they start from and by capturing neutral buildings or the ones of opponents.[9] There are several winning conditions, different for each match: destroying all the opposing armies by capturing all the buildings on the map; capturing specific buildings faster than the opponents; being first to have the points counted down to zero. A player is defeated if all of his units are destroyed, it also takes capturing all of his buildings.\n","\n","\n","Gameplay[edit]\n","\n","Mutant Football League is a violent, over-the-top interpretation of the game of football. It draws inspiration from the original Mutant League Football, as well as other games in the genre such as NFL Blitz.\n","\n","The game features 7-on-7 action, with teams made up of various mutants, namely Skeletal Deadheads, Monstrous Orcs, BruiserBots, Mutant-Humans, Hell-Spawned Demons, Rampaging Werewolves, and Criminal Aliens.[5] The fields are littered with obstacles, including buzzsaws and landmines. Players can call normal plays, as well as \"dirty tricks\", which include bribing the referee, using a chainsaw to cut through the opposition defense, and rigging the ball with a bomb.\n","\n","\n","Gameplay[edit]\n","\n","The player uses the A or B button to jump once, and pressing that button again, while in midair, causes the character to hover for several seconds. The player can also shoot with either the X or Y buttons. Most enemies in the game must be shot several times to be killed. While standing on an orange launch pad, jumping will send you into the background, or foreground. The gameplay generally remains the same, as this is mainly to make use of the 3D capabilities of the 3DS. The PC version, due to the fact that 3D visuals aren't standard, uses a depth of field effect when it jumps between the background and foreground.\n","\n","The main levels in the game are put into one of four \"worlds\". The later worlds' levels are only unlockable by defeating a certain number of previous stages. Within each level, there are three objectives. The main and most straightforward—one is simply to get to the end of the stage and collect the Water Sprite. The second objective is to collect all the golden diamonds for that level. In each one, there are exactly 100 golden diamonds scattered throughout the area. The third and usually most challenging objective is finding and completing the secret \"land\" hidden within each stage. There is a door labeled \"CGA-land\", \"G-land\" or \"V-land\" hidden somewhere in each area, and entering it transports Max to a short, but challenging, secret stage needed to fully complete the game.\n","\n","At the start of every level, Max is given unlimited ammunition and three hearts. The character will lose one heart every time he runs into an enemy or any obstacle meant to cause him harm. Some obstacles, however, like spikes and lava, will instantly kill him. There is also a four-minute time limit (3DS version only) that will instantly end the player's game if the level is not completed within that time. By collecting enough golden diamonds, Max can unlock upgrades that he can equip one at a time: an extended jetpack for crossing larger gaps, a rocket jump for reaching high up areas and a bazooka for breaking through barriers. These must be used to access some of the G-Land and V-Land areas.\n","\n","The 20 bonus levels, included in the PC version of the game and as free downloadable content for the 3DS version, sees players taking control of Max's grandmother, Granny. She is able to use all the upgrades simultaneously.\n","\n","Plot[edit]\n","\n","The game begins with a short cutscene. It shows two people, one of them, Max, the main protagonist, sitting in a small living room and playing a video game, until a large meteor suddenly hits. The scene fades to black, then shows a news station on TV reporting on a \"Muddy\" invasion, and equipped with only a water gun and a jetpack, Max goes to stop the Mutant Mudds not long after. Legend has it that the Water Sprites are able to erase any kind of dirt or mud, and that collecting them all will get rid of the Mutant Mudds for good. After that, the player is immediately thrust into the tutorial level, where one learns the controls.\n","\n","\n","None\n","Games[edit]\n","\n","The MX vs. ATV series is a cumulative crossover between THQ's MX trilogy and Sony's ATV Offroad Fury series.

The protagonist is instructed by Pedro (a floating sentient banana) that Mitch is an arms dealer and must be eliminated. Upon escaping the butchery and killing Mitch, the protagonist heads to the district Null, an abandoned community project now home to a man named Denny and his army of bounty hunters. When confronting Denny he flees but reveals that his sister Ophelia controls the Internet. The protagonist deals with Denny and heads via the sewers to confront Ophelia. After defeating Ophelia, it is revealed that the protagonist has been systematically killing his own family: with Mitch being his father, Denny his brother and Ophelia his sister. Pedro reveals to the player that the protagonist despised his family for their criminal activities, but could not bring himself to kill them, so he knocked himself unconscious and erased his memory so that he could eliminate his family without guilt. Upon revealing this, Pedro jams himself into the protagonist's ear and tries to have him shoot himself. The final battle is a visual representation of the protagonist's mental struggle to resist Pedro's influence. With Pedro defeated, the protagonist removes his mask, revealing that he was Pedro all along with the banana being nothing but a figment of his imagination.\n","\n","\n","None\n","None\n","None\n","Plot[edit]\n","\n","The game takes place long after civilization has been destroyed, where humans have emerged from underground and begun rebuilding society.

A few of the characters in the game gain entirely new movesets after transforming. With the d-pad, players can use preset items during a match that either damage the opponent or provide various status effects like increasing attack power, or lowering the opponent's defense.

If it hits, both players either input button commands, mash a certain button, or spin the analogue stick the fastest during the time limit. If the attacking player wins, the ultimate will hit, typically taking away around a third to a full bar of the opponent's health. If the defending player wins, they will escape without major damage.

Their only chance at salvation is through the Ten Days of Judgement competition, held annually to cull the demons infesting Heaven. The Neon who can kill the most demons by the competition's end will receive a mechanical halo that will allow them to stay in Heaven for a year. White and the other Neons are given weapons and non-removable, explosive masks that the Believers can detonate to execute any Neon who steps out of line.

The pair encounter Green, and Yellow is killed when he blocks an attack meant for White. As Green makes his escape after being defeated by White, he explains that the Believers crafted his halo using a page from the Book of Death, and promises that he has plans for White. Following the confrontation, White learns of the counterpart Book of Life, and decides to seek it out as his suspicions about the competition and the Believers mount.\n","\n","White catches up with Green, who tells him the Book of Life is at Heaven's Edge. Red intervenes to prevent a second fight, and reveals their shared past: White, Red, Yellow, and Violet had worked together as a crew of assassins under the leadership of Green, and their last operation had been to assassinate Blue, who was Green's old boss. They all died during the mission, although Green successfully killed Blue. The next day, Mikey refuses White's request to be assigned to Heaven's Edge, explaining that he knows the competition is a sham and that he would rather see White for ten days every year than risk him being unable to return to Heaven ever again. White and Red venture into Heaven's Edge anyway, but Mikey catches up to them and divulges the truth. Heaven was originally Sheol, but Sheol did not live up to the Believers' expectations of the afterlife and they eventually overthrew God to seize his books and remake the realm into their ideal version of paradise. The Believers also killed most of the angels during the war, and only spared those angels who swore loyalty and service to them. The Believers defeated God and acquired the Book of Death, but God closed his hands around the Book of Life and the Inkhorn used to write into both divine books, preventing the Believers from gaining total power over Heaven and leaving it vulnerable to demonic invasion. As Mikey concludes his story, a stray page from the Book of Life appears, giving White a way to seek out the location of the full book.\n","\n","White arrives at the Third Temple, where he finds one of God's hands clenched around the Book of Life. The hand opens at White's approach, but Violet, who was slighted by White earlier, swoops in and snatches the book, only for Green to fatally wound her. As White and Green clash, Green's mechanical halo is broken, freeing him from the Believers' control. The vengeful Green declares he will use the books to destroy Heaven, but Violet stymies his plan by blowing herself up and scattering the Book of Life's pages. Green returns to Outer Heaven and steals the Book of Death from the Believers, preventing them from detonating the Neons' masks. All of the remaining Neons begin to riot throughout Heaven, and Green kills off the Believers. Meanwhile, White uses the remaining page of the Book of Life to recover its pages and reassemble it.\n","\n","Once the Book of Life is whole, White turns his attention to the Inkhorn, the last item needed to bring back God. In the course of the search, Mikey reveals to White that the sinners who float up to Heaven are free of guilt, which make them the best Neons as they are unquestioning; White had been weighed down by guilt, but he ascended to Heaven anyway because Red pulled him up, and this unusual method of entry caused his amnesia. God's other hand is found, but it lies outside Heaven and a soul is needed to trigger the process to push it into Heaven so it can reopen. Red sacrifices herself by detonating her mask, and Green and White have a final duel over the Books and the Inkhorn. White is once again victorious, and the angels undertake the ritual to restore God. However, Green reappears and charges at White, intent on writing everyone's names into the Book of Death.\n","\n","If White failed to collect enough gifts to unlock all of his memories, White's only option is to write Green's name into the Book of Death, wherein Green is transformed into a demon and sent to Hell. God then writes Yellow, Violet, and Red's names into the Book of Life, but excludes White because he failed to earn salvation. If all memories have been unlocked, White is given a second option to write Green's name into the Book of Life, forgiving Green for his actions and showing that White can let go of his past issues.

Once Nabbit is caught, Toad rewards the item to the player.\n","\n","Along with returning elements such as Ice Flowers and Yoshis, the flying squirrel is new a power-up that allows players to glide across long distances or slowly descend down vertical paths[3] and cling to the side of the walls.[5] Additionally, Baby Yoshis are an item can be carried by a player, with each baby Yoshi having a special ability dependent on its color, such as inflating in midair or illuminating dark areas.[4] Some older power-ups also have new abilities, such as the Mini Mushroom now allowing players to run up walls.[6] New Super Mario Bros. U features one large map containing all the game's worlds and levels, similar to that of Super Mario World. Some levels have multiple exits that lead to the different areas on the map.[7]\n","\n","The game features two new modes of play, \"Challenge Mode\" and \"Boost Rush\". Challenge Mode adds restrictions and conditions, such as clearing levels with a short timer. Boost Rush takes place on an automatically scrolling level which increases in speed as players collect coins, with the goal of clearing the stage as quickly as possible.[6] \"Coin Battle\" from New Super Mario Bros. Wii also returns, with the player now being able to customize the battles with the GamePad to place the coins and Star Coins on the course.  The Super Guide, which takes control of the player's character and moves it automatically through a level, is available in case the player has failed a level multiple consecutive times.[8] The game originally utilized the now defunct Miiverse, which allowed players to share comments about particular levels with one another.[5]\n","[9]\n","\n","Plot[edit]\n","\n","Princess Peach is held captive in her castle by Bowser, Bowser Jr., and the Koopalings who invade and use a giant mechanical arm to throw Mario, Luigi, and two Toads far away.

In addition to standard navigation on foot, the game features scenarios with flying mech battles, as well as a special item that can summon wild animals to ride.[1][2] Non-playable characters (NPCs) found throughout the world offer quest objectives, and shops in hub locations sell various items, including consumables that recover health.[2]\n","\n","Combat uses a real-time action-based hack and slash system, using both light and heavy attacks and combining them into different combination attacks. The player can also evade incoming attacks, gaining invulnerability or counterattack bonuses based on timing. The player is assisted by a flying \"Pod\" robot which launches customizable ranged attacks varying from simple gunfire to heavy-hitting hammer attacks.[1][3] The first protagonist 2B alternates between two weapons, the second protagonist 9S combines light attacks with hacking into enemies, and the final protagonist A2 can sacrifice health to briefly boost her attack power.[4] There are four classes of weapons available; short swords, long swords, bracers, and spears. Attacks with different weapon types can be charged and launched for increased damage.[1][3]\n","\n","Players earn experience points through combat,  increasing their health, defense, and attack power.[1] Character customization is handled through attribute-changing items called chips. Chips can alter the HUD, add new abilities, and grant status buffs to the player characters. The number of chips that can be installed at any one time is limited to the number of slots a character has. Chips can either be purchased at shops or collected from defeated enemies.[2][5] If the player character dies, they respawn at their previous save point. The player character can then find their original body and either attempt to repair it or retrieve items and experience from it to gain a bonus. If the repair attempt is successful, the body is resurrected as a temporary ally, but if the attempt is unsuccessful, it becomes an enemy the player can fight.[1] With online features enabled, the bodies of other players can also be retrieved or revived where they died.[6][7]\n","\n","At certain points, the gameplay changes to reflect different video game genres, such as shoot 'em up and text adventure segments; many of these are indicated by a shift from the normal third-person perspective to a top-down or side-scrolling view.[3][6][8] Some areas also include platforming elements, requiring the player to jump between platforms or over obstacles.[2] Automata has 26 different endings; five main endings lettered A to E, and 21 additional endings lettered F through Z.

Characters have three different types of attacks: light attacks, which are weak but quick and can be used to perform combos; strong attacks, which are slower but do more damage and knock opponents back further; and special attacks, the properties of which vary by character. Different attacks can be performed by pushing up or down or running in combination with one of the three attack buttons. Players can also grab and throw opponents or enemy projectiles, even in the air, and guard against attacks without penalty, though they will be pushed back in doing so. Unique to the game is the \"strafe\" function, where players can hold a button to prevent their character from turning around while moving in different directions; this can be used to continue attacking an opponent while actively retreating from them. As characters take damage, the amount of knockback caused by opponents' attacks will increase, making them easier to knock off the stage. Each stage offers a different layout, with some also having additional hazards that can cause damage to the characters. An update in June 2022 added 16 items to the game, which can be toggled in the match options. These items will spawn intermittently on the battlefield and can be grabbed and thrown to inflict damage on opponents in different ways.[5]\n","\n","The game supports local and online multiplayer for up to four players, with the game's online functionality utilizing rollback netcode on supported platforms.[6] The game also features a single-player arcade mode and a \"Sports\" mode, based on the \"Slap Ball\" game type from the developer's previous fighting game Slap City. In Sports mode, players must knock a ball into an opponent's goal, with different types of balls having different properties, such as soccer balls being unable to be grabbed.[7] Players are able to unlock images displayed in an in-game gallery, music for the game's sound test, and online profile icons.[8]\n","\n","\n","Gameplay[edit]\n","\n","Nickelodeon Kart Racers features a selection of twelve playable characters from SpongeBob SquarePants, Hey Arnold!, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, and Rugrats. 24 courses and 8 arenas based on different locations from the shows are included in the game.[4]\n","\n","It also has a team-based co-op mode, where two players can use a hammer to stop every other team and get an advantage.

Mae's journal, in which she draws pictures for each major in-game event, was given to her by the town doctor to write down her emotions after she bludgeoned a student with a softball bat during a dissociative episode six years prior to the game's events. This incident caused the townsfolk to become wary of Mae and imposed a financial and emotional strain on her family. Mae's dissociation worsened at college, so she chose to return home, hoping that being in a familiar place would help her return to normal.\n","\n","Still wounded, Mae ventures out into the woods to find the hooded group, only for Gregg, Bea, and Angus to arrive, refusing to let her go alone. The group enters the old mines and confronts the mysterious cult, who has been kidnapping people who \"will not be missed\", including their missing friend Casey, into the mines to be sacrificed to a god-like chthonic entity called the Black Goat in the hope that it will revitalize the economy of Possum Springs. The cult's leader allows the group to leave, threatening them never to tell anyone about the cult. But while the group is leaving in the mine's elevator, a cultist ambushes them and attacks Mae. The others manage to save her and the elevator falls, collapsing the mine and presumably trapping the cult underground.\n","\n","The next day, depending on whom the player interacted with the most throughout the course of the game, Mae sits down with either Bea or Gregg and discusses the events of the previous night, and all the happenings in Possum Springs.

The other two characters that the player does not command fight freely on their own. To fight enemies, players use melee attacks, magical abilities and \"Higgledies\". Higgledies are small creatures which exist in several forms, representing one of six elements, each with their own strengths.

They start on a randomized planet near a crashed spacecraft towards the edge of the galaxy, and are equipped with a survival exosuit with a jetpack, and a \"multitool\" that can be used to scan, mine and collect resources as well as to attack or defend oneself from creatures and hostile forces. The player can collect, repair, and refuel the craft, allowing them to travel about the planet, between other planets and space stations in the local planetary system, engage in space combat with alien factions, or make hyperspace jumps to other star systems.[8] While the game is open ended, the player may follow the guidance of the entity known as The Atlas to head towards the centre of the galaxy.[9]\n","\n","The defining feature of No Man's Sky is that nearly all parts of the galaxy, including stars, planets, flora and fauna on these planets, and sentient alien encounters, are created through procedural generation using deterministic algorithms and random number generators from a single seed number. This 64-bit value leads to there being over 18 quintillion[e] (1.8×1019) planets to explore within the game.[10] Very little data is stored on the game's servers, as all elements of the game are created through deterministic calculations when the player is near them, assuring that other players will see the same elements as another player by travelling to the same location in the galaxy. The player may make temporary changes on planets, such as mining resources, but these changes are not tracked once the player leaves that vicinity.[11][12] Until July 2020, the game used different servers for each platform versions; following a July 2020 patch, cross-platform play was enabled for all supported platforms.[13]\n","\n","Through exploration, the player is credited with units, the in-game currency, by scanning planets, alien bases, flora and fauna in their travels.[14][15] If the player is first to discover one of these, they can earn additional units by uploading this information to The Atlas, as well as having their name credited with the discovery to be seen by other players. Players have the opportunity to rename these features at this point within limits set by a content filter.[16][17] No Man's Sky can be played offline, but interaction with The Atlas requires online connectivity.[9][11]\n","\n","The player must assure the survival of the Traveller, as many planets have dangerous atmospheres such as extreme temperatures, toxic gases, and dangerous storms.[16] Though the player can seek shelter at alien bases or caves, these environments will wear away at the exosuit's shielding and armour and can kill the Traveller, thus the player must collect resources necessary for survival. By collecting blueprints, the player can use resources to craft upgrades to their exosuit, multitool, and spacecraft to make survival easier, with several of these upgrades working in synergistic manners to improve the survivability and capabilities of the Traveller.[8] Each of these elements have a limited number of slots for both upgrades and resource space, requiring the player to manage their inventories and feature sets, though the player can either gain new slots for the exosuit or purchase new ships and multitools with more slots.[18] Many features of the exosuit, multitool, and spacecraft need to be refuelled after prolonged use, using collected resources as a fuel source.[19][20]\n","\n","While on a planet, the Traveller may be attacked by hostile creatures. They also may be attacked by Sentinels, a self-replicating robot force that patrols the planets and takes action against those that take the planet's resources. The player can fend these off using the weapons installed on the multitool. The game uses a \"wanted level\". Low wanted levels may cause small drones to appear which may be easily fought off, while walking machines, such as the Walker or Quad can assault the player at higher wanted levels.[8][21] While in space, the Traveller may be attacked by pirates seeking their ship's cargo, or by alien factions with whom they have a poor reputation. Here, the player can use the ship's weapon systems to engage in these battles. Should the Traveller die on a planet, they will be respawned at their last save point without their exosuit's inventory; the player can recover these materials if the player can reach the last death location. If the Traveller dies in space, they will similarly respawn at the local system's space station, but having lost all the goods aboard their ship.[7][14] Again, these goods can be recovered by travelling to the point at which the player died in space, but with the added uncertainty of pirates claiming the goods first.\n","\n","Most star systems have a space station where the Traveller can trade resources, multitools, and ships, and interact with one or more aliens from three different races that populate the galaxy, as well as other travellers. Trading posts planets offer similar functions. Each alien race has their own language, with word-for-word substitutions which initially will be nonsense to the player.[22] By frequent communications with that race, as well as finding monoliths scattered on planets that help in translating, the player can better understand these languages and perform proper actions when interacting with the alien non-player characters, gaining favour from the alien and its race for future trading and combat.[22][23][24] Consequentially, improper responses to aliens may cause them to dislike the Traveller, and their space-bound fleets may attack the Traveller on sight.[25] The game includes a free market galactic store accessible at space stations and trading posts, where some resources and goods have higher values in some systems compared to others, enabling the player to profit on resource gathering and subsequent trade.[9][26]\n","\n","The game has deep crafting capabilities, allowing players to craft technology upgrades, components for more complex items, tradable resources, base construction parts, food and ammo. Crafting requires blueprints, which are unlocked by digging up data modules and trading them in at spacestations. Resources are stored in inventories in the players exosuit, ship, freighter, exocraft, nutrient processor, and storage containers. Resources can be processed into other resources using refiners or nutrient processors, allowing all kinds of food to be created.\n","\n","No Man's Sky is primarily designed as a single-player game, though discoveries can be shared to all players via the Steam Workshop, and friends can track each other on the game's galactic map. Hello Games' Sean Murray stated that one might spend about forty hours of game-time to reach the centre of the galaxy if they did not perform any side activities, but he also said that he fully anticipated that players would play the game in a manner that suits them, such as having those that might try to catalogue the flora and fauna in the universe, while others may attempt to set up trade routes between planets.[27] Players can track friends on the galactic map and the system maps.[28] Due to limited multiplayer aspects at launch, Sony did not require PlayStation 4 users to have a PlayStation Plus subscription to play the game online.[29]\n","\n","Plot[edit]\n","\n","\n","Gameplay[edit]\n","\n","Throughout the game, the player controls the character Travis Touchdown.

Money is also required to compete in a Ranking fight.\n","\n","Control is handled through the Wii Remote and Nunchuk attachment, with the Remote controlling his weapon, the beam katana, and the Nunchuk moving Travis. Most attacks are performed using the \"A\" button, with certain other moves, including the \"death blow\" and sword lock struggles, executed by following on-screen instructions. Further, since the beam katanas run on batteries, they must be charged from time to time by pressing the \"1\" button on the remote and shaking it.[9] Travis's beam katana can also be upgraded and replaced throughout the game by visiting Dr. Naomi. While the katana does not follow the exact position of the remote, it is able to distinguish between a \"high\" and \"low\" position which varies the character stance and the attacks done. In addition to attacks with the beam katana Travis can kick and punch, and when enemies are stunned he can throw them with a number of professional wrestling maneuvers, done by manipulating both the Wii Remote and Nunchuk.\n","\n","Travis has a secondary mode, \"Dark Side\", that is accessed when three icons line up in a slot machine after a successful death blow.

After meeting with Sylvia Christel, he accepts a job to kill Helter Skelter, also known as \"the Drifter,\" which earns him rank 11 by the United Assassins Association, a governing body of assassins.

Travis, now convinced there's no way out, goes on to kill every other assassin except for number eight, Shinobu, whom he spares because he wants her to get stronger. During the 5th ranked battle he meets Henry, a mysterious Irish man who wields a beam katana similar to Travis' own.\n","\n","Before meeting the top-ranked assassin, Travis is told that the UAA was just an elaborate con set up by Sylvia, who overheard his drunken ramblings and organized his entry so that he could finally have revenge on his half-sister, Jeane, who murdered his parents. Jeane reveals in a fast-forwarded cutscene that their father had sexually abused her all her life, thus forcing her to become a prostitute to survive and become a killer. Travis is eventually saved by Shinobu and kills Jeane.\n","\n","The game really ends with Travis being attacked by another assassin before Henry saves him, and challenges him to one last fight. It is during this fight that Henry reveals two twists: first, that he is Travis's twin brother, and second, that Sylvia is his wife (which would make her Travis' sister-in-law), and has a habit of disappearing before returning with lots of money (presumably due to conning people). Travis says to Henry \"She's a bad wife, but a good woman.\" Insinuating Travis slept with Sylvia after becoming the #1 ranked assassin. Still locked in combat, the brothers discuss the nature of these revelations and their situation while they run down a long street. Finally, as the two leap towards each other for the final clash, the screen flashes and is revealed to be a painting hanging in an art gallery, where a little girl, Jeane, and her mother, Sylvia, are observing it.\n","\n","The Japanese version's instruction booklet, entitled the United Assassins Association Official Manual, contains a small manga which contained much of the backstory about the UAA and Travis' first kill.

The game marks a return to the series' open world format last seen in the first game and has the player explore a man-made archipelago, taking on various side activities such as part-time job minigames, and defense missions where the player must battle waves of enemies.[1] In a new addition to the series, the open world is split into five unique islands. The player can traverse around and between the islands with Travis' new modified motorcycle; the \"Demzamtiger\". Travel between islands can also be expedited via a fast travel system.[2] To progress in the game, the player must accrue enough money from missions to pay an entry-fee to a ranked battle. The player must then face off against one of the Rankings' top contenders in a unique boss battle.[3]\n","\n","Combat plays out as a hack-and-slash game in real-time. Similar to the previous mainline games, the combat is predominantly centered around Travis' signature \"Beam Katana\"; a sword with a blade composed of energy. The player can perform various light and heavy combos with the sword. Successful strikes power up the player's \"Tension Gauge\" whereas taking damage depletes it, higher tension leads to longer and more damaging combos. When an enemy has had their health sufficiently depleted, the player is given a directional prompt to execute a \"Killer Slash\"; an unstoppable attack with large range that does heavy damage to adjacent enemies. Upon successful execution of enemies, the player activates the \"Slash Reel\"; a slot machine which gives the random chance of a currency bonus or a power-up. At times the player may lock swords with melee-based enemies, upon which they must perform rotation motions to counter the enemy. The Beam Katana runs on power represented by a battery that gets depleted during attacks. When fully exhausted, the player is left vulnerable and must manually recharge it. The player is able to perform a variety of professional-wrestling techniques on stunned or diverted enemies to deal greater damage and instantly recharge the Beam Katana's battery. Defensive maneuvers exist in the form of blocking and dodging. Dodging an oncoming attack right before it connects initiates a Perfect Dodge, causing enemies to enter a slow-motion state and leaving them susceptible to a flurry of attacks. If the player falls in battle, they are given a random chance of a stat boost upon retrying.\n","\n","New additions to the series' staple combat mechanics include the \"Death Glove\" carried over from Travis Strikes Again: No More Heroes. The Death Glove allows the player to perform a teleporting dropkick. An additional three unique skills are obtained that can aid in combat, which include the ability to perform psychokinetic throws, the ability to set up a sentry that automatically fire projectiles at enemies in a radius, and the ability to set down a field that slows down enemies within the radius. All skills operate on a cooldown timer. If the player rolls a jackpot on the Slash Reel (represented by a triple seven) the player is able to activate one of two \"Full Armor\" modes, which boost the player's attack options and allows them to fire projectiles.[4] A third form of the Full Armor is employed for shooting defense missions, a new side activity which take the form of shoot 'em up mecha battles where the player must defend the planet from large scale aliens.[1]\n","\n","The player can return to Travis' motel in between missions to upgrade various stats such as their health and weaponry. Unlike previous entries in the series, character upgrades employ a separate currency from the one that is used to purchase items and enter ranked battles. Scrap parts derived from battle missions can be sold off for additional currency or used at the motel to construct Death Glove chips that provide various unique stat modifiers, and the player can also order consumable items in the form of sushi that give players stat boosts in battle, such as increased damage or cooldown reduction on Death Glove abilities. At the motel, the player can also play minigames with Travis' cat, customize his wearable attire, collect capsule toys from a gashapon machine, engage in a combat tutorial room, or use a time machine to revisit past bosses.[2][5]\n","\n","\n","None\n","Gameplay[edit]\n","\n","In No Straight Roads, the player takes control of either Mayday or Zuke and can switch between them anytime in single player. The game is designed around a rhythm-based combat system in which the player can move freely without having to follow the beat, but still has to pay attention to audio cues in order to plan their moves.[7] The music notes they collect can be used as ammunition and projectiles, and some objects can be transformed into weapons and defenses during boss battles.\n","\n","Mayday and Zuke attack differently due to their specializations.

In each scenario, the player must allocate resources to raise a capable military force, provide a productive economy to support both military and civilian expansion, and support the peasants in order to sustain their respect and loyalty. Gameplay is taken in turns, with each turn in the map view corresponding to a season, and each turn during battle corresponding to a day. The player may achieve victory through numerous means, among which are forcing the enemy to retreat, destroying the enemy command unit, outlasting an invading force, or prolonging battle until the opposing force has exhausted its supplies.\n","\n","The player can make many choices during the campaign. According to Evan Brooks of Computer Gaming World: \"One may transfer soldiers between fiefs, go to war, increase taxes (which causes a decrease in peasant loyalty which may lead to rebellion), transfer rice or gold to another fief, raise the level of flood control (which decreases productivity), make a non-aggression pact or arrange a marriage, cultivate (which increases productivity, but decreases peasant loyalty), use a merchant (to buy/sell rice, borrow funds, or purchase weapons), recruit for the military (soldiers or ninja), train the army (which increases fighting efficiency), spy on a rival, expand a town (which increases taxes collected, but decreases peasant loyalty), give food/rice to peasants/soldiers (to raise morale), steal peasants from rival daimyos, allocate military strength, recuperate (even a daimyo can get sick), turn over a controlled fief to the computer for administration, or pass a turn.\"[5]\n","\n","Games[edit]\n","\n","\n","None\n","Gameplay[edit]\n","\n","Both games are played entirely as a simulation of a cell phone.

Each character has an ability unique to them, adding an additional element to the gameplay. These individual abilities allow for different play-styles, improving the variety and replay value of the game. Secondary sprites or skins can be acquired for the characters played if the player completes special or secret tasks. The player progresses through the linear level structure until level 7-3, where the final boss, the Nuclear Throne, has to be defeated.

Other enemies cannot be possessed, and must be dealt with by solving the many puzzles in the game, which often involves setting up elaborate traps. Some enemies in the game must be outrun; in some levels Abe has a mount called Elum that helps in this.

When at 100% and above, Kagachi can trigger an empowered state.[6] Using a Daemon in combat earns Soul Stones which unlock that Daemon's skill tree; unlocks include new combat abilities which are equipped to three of the four buttons, stat increases, and small cutscenes related to the Daemon's narrative.[4][7] Using skills repeatedly unlocks bonuses for that attack.[3] New weapons found during exploration and combat can be equipped to Daemons, with these weapons having slots for upgrade gems, which increase weapons stats.[7]\n","\n","\n","None\n","None\n","Gameplay[edit]\n","\n","Ori and the Blind Forest is a 2D Metroidvania; a platform game with an emphasis on exploration, collecting items and upgrades, and backtracking to previously inaccessible areas. The player controls Ori, a white guardian spirit,[3] and Sein, who is the light and eyes of the Spirit Tree.[4] As Ori, players must jump, climb, and use various other abilities to navigate the game's world. Sein can shoot Spirit Flames to combat enemies or break obstacles. Ori is required to interact with the environment by jumping from platforms and solving puzzles, and is faced with various enemies. The player helps Ori collect health cells, energy cells, new abilities, and upgrades. The game world unfolds to the player in the fashion of a Metroidvania, with new abilities allowing the player to access previously inaccessible areas.\n","\n","In addition to save points scattered in the game, players can create \"soul links\" at any time they choose to serve as checkpoints.[5][6] However, soul links can only be created using energy cells collected during gameplay; the needed energy is not in abundant supply, forcing players to create them only when necessary.[6] The player can obtain ability points to gain upgrades and benefits, such as increasing the damage of Sein's Spirit Flame. These upgrades can be achieved when the player has enough ability points to learn the skill they desire, anywhere a soul link has been created. An ability point is gained when Ori collects enough experience by killing enemies, destroying various plants, and finding spirit light containers or ability cells (which instantly awards Ori an ability point). Each skill must be learned in sequential order from one of three ability trees to allow the next skill to be accessible.\n","\n","Plot[edit]\n","\n","The voice of the Spirit Tree in the forest of Nibel narrates the story of when Ori, a guardian spirit, fell from it during a storm as a newborn and was adopted by a creature named Naru, who raised Ori as her own.[7] A cataclysmic event soon makes all of the forest wither, and Naru dies of starvation. Newly orphaned, Ori is left to explore the forest on their own.[5][7][8] After collapsing near the Spirit Tree and being revived by it, Ori later meets Sein, a small orb who guides Ori on a journey to restore the forest.[6] Sein tasks Ori with recovering the light of three main elements supporting the balance of Nibel: Waters, Winds, and Warmth.\n","\n","Ori and Sein come across two beings in their quest: Gumo, the last survivor of the spider-like Gumon clan, who were wiped out by the forest's cataclysm, and whose home supports the Wind element; and Kuro, a giant, shadowy owl who is hostile toward Ori. Gumo initially steals the key to the Water element, but he returns it after Ori saves him from a rockslide. After the Wind element is rekindled, Ori and Sein find Kuro's nest, empty except for a single egg, and they learn the source of her wrath and the forest's cataclysm: when Ori was lost, the Spirit Tree released a flash of light to look for them, which burned and killed all of Kuro's recently hatched offspring when she was away from her nest looking for food. Determined to prevent this from happening to her yet unborn child, Kuro took away the core on top of the Spirit Tree, which is actually Sein. Without its core, the Spirit Tree could not sustain the three elements, and Nibel lost its balance. Meanwhile, Gumo overhears Ori and Sein's intentions to restore Nibel and uses his clan treasure that stores the light from the Spirit Tree to revive Naru, taking her to where Ori is.\n","\n","After the final element, Warmth, is restored in the volcano Mount Horu, Kuro attacks Ori and Sein as the fire from Horu starts to spread. Naru, who had been separated from Gumo, arrives to protect Ori from Kuro. Kuro softens, remembering the pain of losing her children. As the fire spreads and is about to reach her remaining egg, Kuro takes Sein back to the Spirit Tree, which emits a flash of bright light that dissipates the fire and restores the forest, but Kuro is destroyed by the light. Time passes as the forest begins to flourish once more, and Ori watches new spirits being born in the field at the foot of the Spirit Tree. Gumo and Naru watch together from afar, before the latter goes home, where Kuro's last egg now rests, just in time to see it begin to hatch.\n","\n","\n","Gameplay[edit]\n","\n","Ori and the Will of the Wisps is a 2D Metroidvania; a platform game emphasizing exploration, collecting items and upgrades, and backtracking to previously inaccessible areas. The player controls the titular Ori, a white guardian spirit. As Ori, players must jump, climb, glide, and swim between various platforms to solve intricate puzzles. Gameplay unfolds in the form of a Metroidvania, with new abilities and upgrades allowing players to unlock previously inaccessible areas of the map. Some of the foundational gameplay elements were inspired by the Rayman and Metroid franchises.[6]\n","\n","Unlike its predecessor Blind Forest, Will of the Wisps relies on autosaving rather than manually placed \"soul links\". The sequential upgrade system of the first title has been abandoned for a system of \"shards\" (inspired by the Final Fantasy series's \"materia\" system),[7] which can be purchased or found throughout the game to upgrade or modify Ori's stats and attacks. Ori's attacks can be managed via a convenient radial menu,[8] and orbs to increase Ori's health and energy can be found throughout the map.\n","\n","A new mode called Spirit Trials was revealed at Gamescom 2018. The mode challenges players to race to a goal in the fastest time possible. To enhance competition and strategy, players can see the best times and the routes taken by other players.[9] Will of the Wisps also introduces side quests from NPCs to earn collectible items such as Gorlek Ores, which are used to expand the game's hub area.[10]\n","\n","Plot[edit]\n","\n","The story takes place immediately after the events of Ori and the Blind Forest and is narrated by the Spirit Tree in the forest of Niwen. Kuro's last egg hatches, giving birth to a baby owl whom Ori, Naru, and Gumo name Ku and raise as part of their family. Being born with a damaged wing, Ku cannot fly until Gumo affixes Kuro's feather to it. Ku and Ori go on a flight that ends up taking them out of Nibel and into Niwen, where a storm separates them.\n","\n","Ori's search for Ku eventually leads them to Kwolok, a toad looking over the Inkwater Marsh and some of the inhabitants of Niwen, the Moki. He tells Ori that Ku is in the Silent Woods, the Moki's former home now turned into a desolate graveyard of owls, but with the waters of Niwen unclean, Ori must set the wheels of The Wellspring back into motion to enter them. Kwolok also gives Ori a wisp, the Voice of the Forest, to guide them on their journey. Meanwhile, Naru and Gumo head off to Niwen via a raft to find Ori and Ku. Upon setting The Wellspring's wheels back into motion, clearing Niwen's water, Ori enters the Silent Woods. There they reunite with Ku, but the pair encounters Shriek, a deformed, vicious owl who was an orphan at birth and rejected by the rest of her kind, ruling over the Silent Woods and terrorizing Niwen. Shriek attacks Ori and kills Ku.\n","\n","After Ori mourns Ku's death, Kwolok explains that the Voice of the Forest is not at full power and cannot bring Ku back in its current state. Due to the Spirit Willow's prior passing, the light that it carried was shattered into five wisps that scattered across Niwen, leaving the forest vulnerable to corruption and decay that killed the Willow's guardian spirits and Shriek's parents before her birth. Kwolok tasks Ori with seeking the other wisps of the Spirit Willow's light: the Memory, Eyes, Strength, and Heart of the Forest, and merge the four with the Voice to reform the tree's light. Kwolok leaves his marsh to help Ori with locating one of the other wisps, but his body is forcibly taken over by the Stink Spirit, a creature born out of the forest's decay whose body jamming the wheels of The Wellspring had been the cause of its non-functionality. Ori breaks the creature's control over Kwolok, allowing for him to kill it, but their fight leaves him mortally wounded. Before dying, Kwolok pleads to Ori to restore and protect Niwen in his place.\n","\n","Ori eventually finds all five wisps and merges them together to reform Seir, the Golden Light. Ori and Seir head to the Spirit Willow and Seir revives it. However, the tree tells Ori that its time has passed and it can no longer carry Seir, asking Ori to merge with the light to restore Niwen, though Ori would have to leave their previous life behind. The Spirit Willow passes Seir onto Ori, but Shriek appears and snatches it. Ori defeats Shriek, who returns to the Silent Woods to die under the wings of her parents' corpses.\n","\n","Ori merges with Seir, healing Niwen and reviving Ku with her damaged wing restored in the process, which Naru and Gumo arrive in time to witness. Ku, Naru, and Gumo find where Ori and Seir merged, and discover a Spirit Tree beginning to grow there. They help the tree flourish and continue their life as a family together, with the Spirit Tree revealing it was Ori all along, retelling the events leading up to when it merged with Seir. Eventually, the tree completely grows and life begins anew as a new spirit guardian falls from it.\n","\n","\n","Games developed[edit]\n","\n","Games published[edit]\n","\n","\n","Gameplay[edit]\n","\n","The Otterman Empire is a multiplayer third-person shooter party game. It has a single player and four-player couch-co-op campaign mode and players can battle against one another in a player verus player mode. Each player has several characters to choose from, each equipped with unique weapons. Players are able to unlock skins and customize their characters. Players fight across the galaxy of the Otterman Empire. When exploring each map, players can find a range of weapons and unique abilities to pick up and use.[9][10][11][12]\n","\n","\n","Gameplay[edit]\n","\n","The game plays as a traditional visual novel, largely entailing reading with limited player interaction.[1] Player choice primarily comes in the form of the game's SOS (Selection of Soul) system; when at a branching point, the game flow will pause, and a number of dialogue choices will quickly scroll across the screen.[2] The player must quickly choose an option, which will change the course of the conversation.[3] Not answering is an option as well, though it generally incurs a negative outcome from associated characters.[1]\n","\n","\n","None\n","Gameplay[edit]\n","\n","Outer Wilds features an unnamed player character exploring a solar system that is stuck in a time loop, going back 22 minutes before its star goes supernova.[1] Thus, the player is encouraged to learn why by exploring and uncovering secrets of an extinct race known as the Nomai, who previously colonized the solar system hundreds of thousands of years ago.[2] In the first part of the game, the player links with an ancient Nomai statue which ensures that the player retains information discovered in each time loop when it restarts. For example, in order to use the ship, the player must get the launch codes from colleagues at the local observatory. These codes, and the knowledge of them, are the same across subsequent loops, allowing the player to immediately launch the ship without first visiting the observatory.[3]\n","\n","The central premise of the game is exploration, with the player compelled to uncover the remains of the Nomai civilization to find the cause of the time loop and complete the game. All areas of the game are technically immediately accessible to the player upon acquiring the ship launch codes, however many areas are protected by logic puzzles which can often only be solved through learning more of the Nomai and speaking to fellow space explorers.\n","\n","Some events and locations change during the course of the time loop, which means that areas and puzzles are often only accessible at certain times. One example is the paired Ash Twin and Ember Twin planets orbiting so close to each other that sand from Ash Twin is funneled over to cover Ember Twin during the loop. This process gradually reveals the secrets buried on Ash Twin while simultaneously making the Ember Twin cave system inaccessible later on in the time loop.[4][3]\n","\n","The player character has health, fuel, and oxygen meters, which are replenished when the character returns to the ship or by finding trees or refills. The player has several tools, including a camera probe which can be launched long distances and a signalscope for locating broadcast signals. There are no equipment upgrades during the game.\n","\n","After each death, whether the cause is the sun going supernova, or through misadventure — e.g. drowning, falling, exposure to space vacuum — the player respawns and awakens back on their home planet at the start of the time loop.[5][6]\n","\n","Plot[edit]\n","\n","The player takes the role of an unnamed space explorer preparing for their first solo flight. After being involuntarily paired with a statue on their home planet made by the Nomai, an ancient and mysterious race that had once colonized the system, the player discovers they are trapped in a time loop. Every loop resets when the sun goes supernova after 22 minutes, or when the player-character otherwise dies.\n","\n","The player learns that the Nomai were obsessed with finding the \"Eye of the Universe\", a massive anomaly using macroscopic quantum mechanics that is older than the universe itself. Curious to find out what was held within the Eye, but having lost its signal, the Nomai built an orbital cannon to launch probes to visually find the Eye. The chance of visually finding the object with a random shot into space was infinitesimally small, so they also developed a device, the Ash Twin Project, to send the results of the probe's scan 22 minutes back in time, so that the cannon could be \"reused\" an infinite number of times. The amount of power required to go back in time was so high that the only viable way of obtaining it would be from a supernova, so they attempted to artificially induce the sun to explode, but were unsuccessful. The Nomai were wiped out by an extinction-level event after completing construction of these projects but before setting the time-loop process into motion. The system is now operating because the sun has naturally reached the end of its life cycle. The resulting supernova feeds power into the Ash Twin Project, conveying the player's memories back in time to their previous self and resetting the cannon for another scan.\n","\n","Armed with this knowledge, the player is eventually able to recover the coordinates of the Eye and input them into a derelict Nomai interstellar vessel, warping to the Eye's location. They discover that their star is not the only one going supernova. All the stars in the sky have reached the end of their lifespans and the universe is about to end. Upon entering the Eye, the player encounters quantum versions of the various characters they had befriended in their travels, and working together, they create a Big Bang, giving rise to a new universe. The ending shows a similar solar system with new life forms 14.3 billion years after its creation.\n","\n","\n","Gameplay[edit]\n","\n","The Outer Worlds is an action role-playing video game featuring a first-person perspective. In the early stages of the game, the player can create their character and unlock a ship, which acts as the game's central hub space. Though the player cannot control their ship directly, it serves as a fast travel point to access different areas in the game and acts as the player's persistent inventory space.[1] The player can encounter and recruit non-player characters (NPCs) as companions who have their own personal missions and stories. When accompanying the player, the companions act as an aid in combat. Each companion has their own individual skills and special attacks, and they can develop their own skill specialization. When exploring, the player can bring up to two companions alongside them while the rest stay on the ship. The player can make numerous dialogue decisions which can influence the game's branching story. They can respond to NPCs in various ways, such as acting heroically, maniacally, or moronically.[2]\n","\n","During combat situations, the player can use various weapon types such as melee and firearms, which have three ammo types: light, heavy and energy. These weapons can be customized to add elemental damage.[3] The player can use stealth or social skills (persuasion, lying and intimidation) to avoid combat altogether. As the player progresses, they gain experience points, which the player and their companions can use to level up and unlock new skills. The player can develop their technical skills, which are further divided into three categories: Science, Medical, and Engineering. For instance, the player can use a shrink ray to shrink down an enemy. The player is able to invest points into these skills, which will unlock new perks that enhance combat efficiency. The player can also enter a \"Tactical Time Dilation\" state, which slows down time and reveals opponents' health statistics, granting the player tactical advantages. As the player leads their companions, they improve their companions' combat strength and resilience.[2] The player can gain a \"flaw\" that occurs when the player fails repeatedly in certain gameplay segments. Flaws impede the player in some way, but give additional perks and advantages.[4]\n","\n","Plot[edit]\n","\n","\n","Gameplay[edit]\n","\n","In Outlast, the player assumes the role  of investigative journalist Miles Upshur, as he navigates a dilapidated psychiatric hospital in Leadville, Colorado that is overrun by homicidal patients.[5] The game is played from a first-person perspective and features some stealth gameplay mechanics.[6] The player can walk, run, crouch, jump, climb ladders and vault over objects.[7] Unlike most games, however, the player does not have a visible health bar on the screen and is unable to attack enemies. The player must instead rely on stealth tactics such as hiding in lockers, sneaking past enemies, staying in the shadows and hiding behind or under things in order to survive. Alternatively, the player can attempt to outrun their pursuer.[8] If the player dies, the game will reset to the most recent checkpoint.[6]\n","\n","Most of the hospital is unlit, and the only way for the player to see while in the dark is through the lens of a camcorder equipped with night vision.[5] Using the night vision mode will slowly consume batteries, of which there are not many, forcing the player to scavenge for additional batteries found throughout the asylum.[9] Outlast makes heavy use of traditional jump scares and audio cues, which alert the player if an enemy has seen them.[10] If the player records specific events with their camcorder, Miles will write a note about it, providing further insight into his thoughts. Documents can be collected, which offer backstory and other expository  information about the facility,  including pages taken from the diaries of patients and reports from the hospital staff.[9]\n","\n","Developer Red Barrels have pointed to the survival-focused gameplay in Amnesia: The Dark Descent as a primary influence on the combat-free narrative style of Outlast.[11] Found-footage horror films like Quarantine and REC also served as influences.[11]\n","\n","Plot[edit]\n","\n","Freelance investigative journalist Miles Upshur receives an anonymous e-mail that inhumane experiments are being conducted at Mount Massive Asylum, a private psychiatric hospital owned by the notoriously unethical Murkoff Corporation. Upon entering, Miles is shocked to discover its halls ransacked and littered with the mutilated corpses of the staff. He's informed by a dying officer of Murkoff's private military unit that Mount Massive's deranged inmates, known as \"variants\", have escaped and are freely roaming the grounds, butchering Murkoff's employees. The officer implores Miles to escape and reveals that the main doors can be unlocked from security control.\n","\n","Moving on, Miles is suddenly ambushed by a hulking variant named Chris Walker, who knocks him unconscious. While incapacitated, Miles encounters Father Martin Archimbaud, a self-appointed priest with schizotypal personality disorder, who claims Miles is his \"apostle\" and sabotages his escape by cutting off power to the front doors. Miles restores power, but Father Martin injects him with anesthetic. He shows Miles footage of \"the Walrider\", a ghostly entity killing patients and personnel alike, which he claims is responsible for the asylum's ransacking.\n","\n","Regaining consciousness, Miles finds himself trapped in a decaying cell block filled with catatonic and demented patients. He escapes through the sewers to the main wards, pursued by Walker and two cannibalistic twins, only to be captured by Richard Trager, a former Murkoff executive driven insane. Trager amputates two of Miles' fingers with a pair of bone shears, preparing to do the same to his tongue and genitals. However, Miles escapes to an elevator, inadvertently crushing Trager to death between floors when he attacks him.\n","\n","Miles reconvenes with Father Martin, who tells him to go to the asylum's chapel. Reaching an auditorium, Miles learns that the Walrider was created by Dr. Rudolf Gustav Wernicke, a German scientist brought to the U.S. during Operation Paperclip. Wernicke believed that intensive dream therapy conducted on traumatized patients could connect swarms of nanites into a single malevolent being.\n","\n","In the chapel, Miles finds a crucified Father Martin, who gives Miles a key to the atrium elevator that he insists will take him to freedom before immolating himself. Miles takes the elevator, which descends into a subterranean laboratory. Walker attacks him, only to be eviscerated by the Walrider. Miles locates an aged Wernicke, who confirms that the Walrider is a biotechnological nanite entity controlled by Billy Hope, a comatose subject of Murkoff's experiments. He orders Miles to terminate Billy's life support in the hopes that this will destroy the Walrider. Miles accomplishes this task; however, just before Billy dies, the Walrider attacks Miles and possesses his body. On his way out of the laboratory, Miles encounters a Murkoff military team led by Wernicke, which guns him down. A horrified Wernicke realizes that Miles is the Walrider's new host. Panicked screams and gunfire are heard as the screen fades to black.\n","\n","\n","Gameplay[edit]\n","\n","Outlast 2 is a first-person survival horror game that, like its predecessors Outlast and Outlast: Whistleblower, is a single-player campaign.

The player controls the investigative journalist Blake Langermann, who investigates a dilapidated rural area in Supai,[4] near the western edge of the Colorado Plateau.\n","\n","Langermann cannot fight except in scripted scenes, but must run and hide from the numerous hostile members of Temple Gate.[5] The player can crouch, run, jump, walk, vault, slide and climb much like the first game and can hide in lockers, barrels, wardrobes, beds, pools of water, tall grass, cornfields, and inside of houses. He has a limited stamina meter and the player must manage how long he runs, lest he becomes exhausted and move more slowly.\n","\n","Langermann possesses only a camcorder, which has night vision capabilities, though the camcorder's batteries are also drained when night vision is used. Compared to the first game, Langermann's status as a cameraman means he carries a more advanced camera, one with clearer footage, zoom, and a sensitive microphone that can be used to detect distant footsteps and other noises. The player is equipped with an inventory system displaying the amount of footage recorded on the camera and the items they are carrying. Spare batteries suitable for the camcorder and medkits to heal are spread throughout the game.[6]\n","\n","Plot[edit]\n","\n","Blake Langermann is an assisting cameraman for his wife Lynn, an investigative journalist, who is investigating the murder of a pregnant teenager known only as Jane Doe.[2] The couple has a helicopter pilot fly them over the area where the girl possibly came from, although they crash-land in the Supai region[4] of the Coconino County region of Arizona after being hit by a mysterious flash of light. When Blake wakes up after the crash he finds the pilot skinned alive and his wife missing. \n","\n","Blake makes his way to a nearby town, Temple Gate, where he learns that the residents sacrificed all their children in the name of God. Blake eventually locates Lynn in a chapel, captured by a violent and delirious Christian cult led by preacher Sullivan Knoth, who rapes the women of Temple Gate and, once they are pregnant, executes them on suspicion of carrying the Anti-Christ. Knoth claims that Temple Gate lies on the mouth of Hell, and that Lynn is pregnant with the Anti-Christ. They escape the chapel, but Lynn falters, suffering from stomach cramps. The couple is separated when Lynn is kidnapped by a Satanic splinter group known as the Heretics and their androgynous leader Val, who wish to hasten the end of days by witnessing the birth of the Anti-Christ.\n","\n","Blake is rescued by a man named Ethan who has left Knoth's cult and gives him refuge in his home. It is revealed that Ethan's daughter Anna Lee is Jane Doe after he explains that he helped her escape Temple Gate. As Blake rests, Marta, an imposing woman wielding a large pickaxe and who is one of Knoth's executioners, suddenly breaks into Ethan's home and murders him. Blake flees to another chapel, where he learns from a tortured Heretic being interrogated by Knoth that Lynn was taken to the mines near Temple Gate.\n","\n","Blake leaves Temple Gate for the mines but instead ends up in the forests occupied by the syphilis-infected 'Scalled' who were cast out from Temple Gate. He is captured by the Scalled's dwarfish leader Laird Byron and his hulking mount Nick Tremblay, who believe he is the Scalled Messiah. Blake eventually escapes after Laird's followers kill him and Nick.\n","\n","Throughout his journey, Blake is repeatedly assaulted by flashes of light and suffers from increasingly disturbing hallucinations of his Catholic elementary school while pursued by a demon. The hallucinations gradually reveal the events surrounding the apparent suicide of Blake and Lynn's childhood friend, Jessica Gray. It is ultimately revealed that Jessica was molested and murdered by their music teacher, Father Loutermilch, who manipulated Blake into keeping quiet about the incident while making it look like she had hanged herself, and the demon chasing Blake is a twisted version of the priest. Blake also finds a document revealing that the Murkoff Corporation is the cause for everyone's insanity due to an experimental mind control station hidden deep in the mountains, which is also responsible for the flashes of light.\n","\n","Reaching the mines, Blake enters the Heretics' underground temple and finds Lynn visibly pregnant during a Heretic ritual. Knoth's cult also reach the mines and kill the Heretics, allowing the pair to flee. As dawn breaks, a freak lightning storm begins to destroy the town. Marta reappears and attacks Blake and Lynn, but a cross toppled by lightning from a chapel in the distance impales her.

Taking on the name of the guild, Ainz Ooal Gown, as a message to any other remaining players, Momonga begins exploring the world in an attempt to figure out what has happened while searching for anyone or anything that could help him solve this mystery, while ensuring the safety of Nazarick. Ainz Ooal Gown seems to have modifications made to his behavior by in-game mechanics, because he demonstrates no moral qualms with killing and other actions that are taboo in the real world.

The game featured several different game modes, principally designed around squad-based combat with two opposing teams of six players each. Players selected one of over two dozen pre-made hero characters from one of three class types: Damage heroes that deal most of the damage to attack or defend control points, Tank heroes that can absorb a large amount of damage, and Support heroes that provide healing or other buffs for their teammates.[note 2] Each hero had a unique skill kit, defining their intrinsic attributes like health points and running speed, their primary attacks, several active and passive skills, and an ultimate ability that can only be used after it has been charged through dealing damage to enemies and healing allies. Players can change their hero during the course of a match, as a goal of Overwatch's design was to encourage dynamic team compositions that adapt to the situation. The game's genre has been described by some journalists as a \"hero shooter\", due to its design around specific heroes and classes.[2][3]\n","\n","The game featured game modes for casual play, competitive ranked play, and for supporting esports competitions including Blizzard's Overwatch League. These modes were generally centered around sequentially securing control of points on the map, or escorting a payload between points on the map, with one team attacking while the other defends. Other modes set aside for casual matches include solo and team deathmatch, capture-the-flag, and unique modes run during various seasonal events. More recent updates had enabled users to craft their own game modes with a limited set of scripting tools. Regardless of winning or losing a match, players gained experience towards a player level, and on gaining a new level, received loot boxes that contain cosmetic items that they can use to customize the appearance of the hero characters but otherwise does not affect gameplay. Loot boxes could also be purchased through microtransactions.[4]\n","\n","Plot[edit]\n","\n","The backstory to Overwatch is described through animated shorts and other information distributed by Blizzard in promoting the game.[5][6][7]\n","\n","Overwatch is set sixty years into the future of a fictionalized Earth, thirty years after the resolution of what is known as the \"Omnic Crisis.\"[8] Before the Omnic Crisis, humanity had been in a golden age of prosperity and technology development. Humans developed robots with artificial intelligence called \"Omnics\", which were put to use to achieve economic equality, and began to be treated as people in their own right. The Omnic Crisis began when the worldwide automated \"omnium\" facilities that produced them started producing a series of lethal, hostile robots that attacked humankind. After individual nations' efforts failed to ward off the Omnics, the United Nations quickly formed Overwatch, an international task force designed to combat this threat and restore order.[9]\n","\n","Two veteran soldiers from the Soldier Enhancement Program were put in charge of Overwatch: Gabriel Reyes and Jack Morrison. Though Overwatch successfully quelled the robotic uprising and brought many talented individuals to the forefront, a rift developed between Reyes and Morrison due to Reyes being the official leader of the group despite everyone viewing the more popular Morrison as their true leader. Eventually, Morrison was made the leader of Overwatch while Reyes was given charge of Blackwatch, Overwatch's covert operations division, fighting terrorist organizations like Talon, a group that appears to be trying to start a second Omnic Crisis, and Null Sector, a group of Omnics that revolted against the society that persecuted Omnics following the first Crisis.[9] Overwatch continued to maintain peace across the world for several decades in what came to be called the \"Overwatch Generation\" as the team gained more members, but the rift between Morrison and Reyes intensified. One night, Blackwatch was dispatched to arrest a notorious mobster with ties to Talon. After infiltrating the compound, Reyes chose to execute the mobster rather than let him buy his way out of prison. This action caused Blackwatch and their less heroic actions to be exposed to the public. Several allegations of wrongdoing and failures were leveled at Overwatch, leading to a public outcry against the organization and in-fighting between its members, prompting the UN to investigate the situation. During this, an explosion destroyed Overwatch's headquarters in Switzerland, purportedly killing Morrison and Reyes among others. The UN passed the Petras Act, which dismantled Overwatch and forbade any Overwatch-type activity.[9]\n","\n","Overwatch is set six years after the Petras Act; without Overwatch, corporations have started to take over, fighting and terrorism have broken out in parts of the globe, and there are signs of a second Omnic Crisis occurring in Russia. The intelligent gorilla Winston, a former member of Overwatch, decides to begin reforming Overwatch to protect the peace once again despite the Petras Act, with the team members recruiting old friends and gaining new allies in their fight.[10] It is revealed that Reyes and Morrison were not killed in the explosion resulting from their battle: Morrison became a masked vigilante known as \"Soldier: 76\", who is trying to uncover the reasons why Overwatch was shut down, while Reyes joined Talon. Which lead to him being expiermentied on by Moira[11] who then became \"Reaper\", a terrorist with a Death-like appearance.\n","\n","\n","Gameplay[edit]\n","\n","Overwatch 2 is a hero shooter, where players are split into two teams and select a \"hero\" from a roster of 35 characters. Characters are organized into a \"damage\" class, responsible for offensive efforts; a \"support\" class, responsible for healing and buffing; and a \"tank\" class, responsible for creating space for their team. Each character has a unique set of skills, made up of active, passive, and ultimate abilities. Overwatch 2, like its predecessor, primarily centers on player versus player (PvP) combat across several different modes and maps, and includes both casual and ranked competitive matches.\n","\n","The original Overwatch was designed for six-on-six team combat, with two of each class on a team. In Overwatch 2, the number of tank slots was reduced by one, bringing the total number of players per team to five. According to game director Aaron Keller, developers hoped that losing a tank would speed up gameplay as they believed that the original six players scheme rendered gameplay slow. It is also intended to ease the amount of things players and spectators need to watch out for. New maps were designed to include more cover options to compensate for reduced tank-based protection.[1] Additionally, damage class heroes now have an increased movement speed, support heroes slowly regenerate, and tank heroes were redesigned so they could take on a more offensive role. Heroes were visually refurbished as to reflect the passage of time since the events of the first game.[2] Overwatch 2 includes a ping system to direct the attention of teammates to specific points on the map.[3]\n","\n","The game also introduces a new PvP mode named \"Push\", similar to tug of war, in which teams vie for control of a robot that pushes a team's payload to the opponent's side of the map. Along with being incorporated into Unranked and Competitive play, Push has become part of the standard map rotation of the Overwatch League, replacing the Assault mode.[4] Some existing gameplay modes may be dropped in Overwatch 2; former game director Jeff Kaplan has stated that some Assault maps (colloquially referred to as \"2CP\", meaning \"two control points\"), such as Paris and Horizon Lunar Colony, will likely not be available in Overwatch 2 as these have been deemed unbalanced in response to community feedback. Other Assault maps, such as Hanamura and Temple of Anubis, may be available in the form of custom games or non-competitive arcade modes.[5]\n","\n","The game features player versus environment (PvE) game modes. Similar to the special seasonal events, they will consist of four-player cooperative missions against non-playable characters and are available on a permanent as opposed to a seasonal basis. In this mode, players can garner experience points for their hero and unlock new passive abilities called \"talents\", allowing them to influence how the hero plays. There are least two PvE modes; a story-based mission mode, where players are limited to their hero selection in replaying missions based on Overwatch lore, and Hero missions which allow all heroes to be used in fending off waves of enemies at various locations. Blizzard anticipates that Overwatch 2 will offer over 100 different PvE missions, utilizing new maps as well as existing multiplayer maps expanded out to include new areas, and adding in dynamic effects, such as day and night times as well as varying weather conditions. Enemy types are expanded out from the Null Sector robots that were introduced in the original seasonal PvE events, adding in new types with unique behaviors.[2][6]\n","\n","Overwatch 2 was released as free-to-play as opposed to the premium monetization model of its predecessor. It also discontinued loot boxes in favor of a battle pass system which is offered on a seasonal basis and corresponds with the introduction of new maps and heroes. The game also includes an in-game store where players can purchase cosmetics directly.[7][8] Blizzard stated that new heroes will be introduced as rewards on the free tier of the battle pass, and players who fail to make the associated tier will have other routes to obtain the hero for free in later seasons.[9]\n","\n","A Blizzard Battle.net account is required to play Overwatch 2, regardless of platform. Overwatch 2 features cross-progression, with in-game cosmetic items and progress being shared across PC and console versions.[10] Unlocked cosmetic items, in-game currency, and player statistics from any Overwatch profile linked to such an account are merged, and are available on all platforms. Competitive skill ratings are separate, with console and PC ranks remaining independent of each other.[11]\n","\n","\n","Gameplay[edit]\n","\n","The player controls Otus, who is capable of flying and carrying objects during flight.

At the same time, Alex remains free to move around and navigate the game world.[4][5] Players can select dialogue options at any time during conversations, choosing to wait for other characters to finish, to interrupt, or to remain silent. Certain dialogue options cause a thought bubble with Alex inside it to appear over characters' heads, suggesting that the player's choice had an effect on the characters' relationship.[5]\n","\n","Objects that can be interacted with in the game world display a small circle next to them.[3] Puzzles in the game are solved by finding the correct frequency on Alex's handheld radio, which can perform actions such as unlocking doors or communicating with ghosts,[6] or by winding up tape recorders at the correct speed.[3] Oxenfree does not have any \"game over\" loss conditions; the player's choices and relationships with the characters determine which of several possible endings the player receives.[7]\n","\n","Plot[edit]\n","\n","Alex (Erin Yvette), a teenager, is on the last ferry heading to the fictional Edwards Island for a weekend party.

Ren explains the island was once a military base and that the island's only permanent resident, Maggie Adler, has recently died. After camping on the beach, Alex, Ren, and Jonas explore the nearby caves, where it is rumored certain radio frequencies cause supernatural events. In a small cavern, Alex tunes her radio to a floating shape and unexpectedly forms a dimensional rift. A voice answers and the teens experience visions before passing out. Jonas and Alex awake in front of a communications tower elsewhere on the island. Ren calls, having passed out in the woods, while Clarissa calls from the decommissioned military fort on the island.\n","\n","In the woods, Jonas and Alex encounter supernatural events, including Alex's reflection in the water communicating with her, objects moving on their own, and time looping repeatedly. Time corrects when Alex plays a reel-to-reel tape. They spot Nona, who claims she saw an alternate Jonas and Alex. Alex and Jonas find Ren, but after another time loop, they find him possessed by a \"ghost\". Using the radio, Alex creates another rift which returns Ren to normal. Ren and Nona return to the tower.\n","\n","At the military fort, Alex's reflection appears in a mirror, giving Alex advice. A ghost questions them and possesses Jonas, revealing that the ghosts are the crew of the submarine USS Kanaloa, thought lost at sea. Alex creates another rift that revives Jonas. They find Clarissa, but time loops to her jumping to her death before disappearing. Nona, Alex, Jonas, and Ren regroup at Harden Tower. Unable to send a radio transmission off the island, Ren suggests finding the key to Maggie Adler's estate, where she kept a boat. At Adler's estate, a possessed Clarissa talks with Alex; her conversations and scattered letters left behind by Maggie Adler reveal that Adler mistakenly interpreted scrambled messages from Kanaloa as an enemy transmission, and the submarine was sunk by friendly fire. The crew was not killed, but transported to another dimension due to the sub's experimental nuclear reactor. Adler and her friend Anna had attempted to communicate with the Kanaloa crew via a radio, but Anna was absorbed through the rift. The Kanaloa crew intend on using Alex and her friends' bodies to escape the dimension, keeping them on the island long enough for their possession attempts to be successful.\n","\n","Alex and the group discover Maggie Adler's plan to fix the rifts—crossing to the other side of them and tuning the radio within. Alex repeatedly loops back to the past, mainly to times she talked with Michael. A ghost possesses Jonas and attempts to bargain with Alex, offering to spare her and the rest of her friends if they leave Clarissa behind. Returning to the caves, Alex tunes into a rift that sends her into a void. Encountering the possessed Clarissa, the ghosts warn Alex that she will die if the rift is closed, and Clarissa will be kept by the ghosts if Alex leaves through the rift. Alex can choose to leave, erasing Clarissa from existence; close the rift herself, trapping her with the ghosts; or, if she has found enough letters from Maggie Adler, Alex can appeal to the crew members directly, convincing them to let Clarissa and her go. The reflection of Alex giving her advice is revealed to be Alex from the future. She loops back to a conversation with Michael, who admits that he and Clarissa are planning to move away from town and asks for Alex's advice.

Taking control of Pac-Man, players go through various mazes collecting pellets while avoiding the roaming ghosts. Gathering enough pellets will either reveal a bonus item that sends Pac-Man to the next maze or a Power Pellet that can be used to eat ghosts. Unlike previous iterations of Pac-Man, in which touching ghosts would instantly kill Pac-Man, ghosts can now be bumped into up to three times in succession before they enter an Angry state, during which touching them will cause Pac-Man to lose a life. Similar to Championship DX, passing by sleeping ghosts will add them to a trail behind the other ghosts, allowing for large point bonuses when eaten. Players can also use jump pads to jump over parts of a maze and bombs to instantly return to the start of a maze. The game features two main modes: Score Attack, in which players must try and rack up a high score within a time limit, and Adventure, which requires players to clear several objectives, including fighting giant bosses.[2] The Nintendo Switch 'Plus' version also features a co-op mode known as \"Pac-Man Championship Edition 2 Plus 2P\". Player 1 will play as a yellow Pac-Man, while Player 2 plays as a turquoise Pac-Man, while still following the same rules, Players 1 and 2 need to eat fruit together to get to the next maze. When a player gets caught by a ghost, you will have a few seconds to save said player from losing a life. When there are only a few minutes left, a giant ghost will break the stage, putting both players in a bigger maze where you can jump around.

The final level of each world has a boss that Pac-Man must defeat in order to progress.[3] At the beginning of the game, only three worlds are available, while the other three are unlocked by completing all prior worlds.[3] The six worlds in the game each feature distinctive themes, e.g. the first world, Pirate, features ships, cannons, and beaches.[3]\n","\n","Levels contain fruit that can be eaten for bonus points, alongside letters that spell out \"PACMAN\".

He can find small fractions of health to replenish it in levels, as well as extra lives.[3] The player can find crates scattered around in levels, some of them giving Pac-Man access to new abilities, such as a metal suit allowing him to walk underwater.[3] Pac-Man can also interact with objects such as trampolines, doors and ramps, which can be used to solve puzzles to progress through the level.[3] At the main menu, the player can play a port of the original Pac-Man arcade game, which is the same version found in Namco Museum Vol. 1.[3][4]\n","\n","\n","Gameplay[edit]\n","\n","Paladins is a team-based first-person shooter that focuses on two groups of five players each, who compete for combat-based goals.

Some situations with many enemies on screen require the use of the lock-on laser, while in others, quick gunshots to weak spots will prove more efficient.[9]\n","\n","Plot[edit]\n","\n","Panzer Dragoon is set in the distant future, thousands of years after a great war between humans and their biologically engineered weapons, when humans live in everything from small tribes to large nations. One nation, the Empire, has discovered a black tower in the middle of a lake near their capital, which gave them access to large amounts of ancient weapons which they used to beat back and control the ever present monsters in the world. The Imperials were corrupted by this power and became conquerors of others as opposed to liberators from a violent world.[10]\n","\n","The introduction movie opens with the protagonist, Keil Fluge (unnamed in the North American version), hunting in a canyon. After seeing an Imperial flying battleship in the sky, he is attacked by two creatures and chases one of them to a large, ancient complex built directly into the rock. He explores the ruin, and sees relics of old technology still hanging from the ceilings. Another gigantic creature suddenly attacks him, and though his weapon is useless against the armored creature, a rumbling triggers a cave in, which crushes the monster and saves Keil. From the newly created hole, an armored, blue dragon flies down the cavern with a rider across its shoulders, being chased by an even bigger black dragon as the cavern is destroyed in an explosion. Regaining consciousness outside, Keil sees the two dragons locked in combat in the air before him. Dodging a blast from the black dragon, the blue dragon's rider is then hit by single shot to the chest, and the black dragon flies away. The blue dragon flies towards Keil. A psychic connection is made between the rider and Keil, who is told not to let the black dragon reach the black tower. The rider then dies and Keil picks up his fallen gun, climbs atop the dragon and flies away, determined to finish the rider's quest.[11]\n","\n","During the first level of the game, Keil and his dragon fly through a drowned city, where they encounter a small Imperial patrol ship. That ship sends a report to a large fleet of ships flying above the clouds. It is revealed that the Imperial forces are specifically searching for the blue dragon.[12] The second level is a desert, where Keil and the dragon encounter gigantic worm-like creatures. At the stormy edge of the desert, they are confronted by the Black Dragon, which is defeated and speeds away.[13] The third level is a mountainous landscape at night-time where Keil and the dragon get reacquainted with the Imperial forces, which were exploring ancient ruins. These encounters illustrate the ongoing conflict between the Imperial forces and the ancient machines and creatures.[14] The fourth level is an ancient facility in which Keil and the dragon are pursued by both Imperial airships and cybernetic sentinels left behind by the ancient civilization.[15] During the fifth level, they defeat a large armada of the most powerful Imperial ships over a forested area. A cutscene then shows a fleet of dragon-like creatures coming out of the tower to attack the Imperial forces.[16] The sixth level features the black dragon and Keil racing through the battle-scarred Imperial capital. During this, they are both waylaid by the creatures and machines seen attacking the Imperial fleet around the tower while also being fired on by Imperial defenses.[17] The black dragon then reaches the Tower and is mutated into a gigantic super-dragon and begins a climactic battle with Keil and the blue dragon, after which the black dragon is defeated and falls into the ocean.[18]\n","\n","In the ending cutscene, Keil and the dragon enter the tower. While traveling down a long corridor, the dragon surrounds Keil in a force field, lifting him from the saddle and suspending him in the hallway. Keil watches as the dragon continues on to the core of the tower, then a blinding light is seen and the tower explodes. Keil wakes up some time later in a desert area abutting the ocean. Looking down, he sees the foot prints of the blue dragon around him, indicating that after the explosion, the dragon carried him to safety and flew away.[19]\n","\n","\n","Gameplay[edit]\n","\n","The game consists of 17 levels, during which players take control of either the slow but powerful Paladin mech Grit or the small but swift Squire pilot Flame. When commanding Grit, the player can pick up discarded melee weapons dropped by defeated enemies and use them in battle against them. The combat mechanics include a high-versus-low attacking and blocking system (similar to Zelda II), along with a rock-paper-scissors style weapon triangle system that grants your weapons damage bonuses or reductions depending on the weapon used by the enemy.[4][5][6]\n","\n","The game also implements a weapon durability system similar to Breath of the Wild where weapons degrade and eventually break after enough uses, with some weapons being more durable than others. Every weapon has a predetermined spell within them that the player can cast at any time by breaking the weapon intentionally, ranging from recovery and defensive spells to ranged or screen-clearing attacks. Weapons can also be thrown at enemies to deal extra damage at the cost of breaking the weapon or be left at a pedestal to act as a checkpoint upon death.[7]\n","\n","Similar to Blaster Master, the player can also eject from Grit at any time to play as Flame. She is quick and able to fit through tight spaces, although she cannot pick up weapons dropped by enemies and has significantly less health than Grit. She wields a Castlevania-style laser whip that allows her to attack enemies at a distance, siphon energy from power tanks to replenish Grit's health and swing around on ring hooks to reach new areas. Teleportation pads scattered throughout each level allow for Grit to be teleported to Flame's location should the two get separated, but Flame can traverse most levels completely by herself if need be.[7]\n","\n","Stage progression is very similar to the Mega Man series, where each stage's boss is visible beforehand on the stage select screen and each stage can be selected and completed in any order you wish (with some exceptions). Between missions, the unused weapons you have acquired can be converted into Spirit Points that can be used to increase Grit's maximum health once enough are collected.

Throughout the game, the player sets out to follow each of five streamers, which occupy wide open areas for exploration. These areas contain puzzles the player will need to complete to proceed.\n","\n","Along the way, Mario can collect coins used to purchase items for use in combat, and hidden treasures to display at a museum.[4] Among these hidden collectibles are Toads, which are either folded into origami or creased and crumpled. Mario can interact with non-player characters, some of which will join the player's party temporarily and can assist Mario in combat or interact with obstacles in the overworld.[5] In certain areas of the game, Mario can use an ability known as the \"1000-Fold Arms\", that can tear back parts of the paper environment to reveal secrets.[6] Mario can fill holes in the environment using a bag of confetti.[7]\n","\n","The player fights enemies using a turn-based battle system. When Mario encounters one or more enemies in the overworld, the game transitions to a battle screen. During battle, Mario stands at the center of a dartboard-like arena divided into four ring-shaped sections with 12 radial slots; each enemy occupies a different slot.[8] At the start of the player's turn, they can slide the rings horizontally or vertically to position enemies so that several of them can be attacked at once. The player is allotted a limited amount of time and number of rotations. Once the player has finished shifting the enemies, they can attack with a hammer, which targets enemies in a two-by-two section of the grid adjacent to the center, or with boots, which target a one-by-four line of enemies.[9] The player can use items with varying power to attack enemies, or increase their heart points. Their attack power is boosted during a turn if the number of enemies targeted is maximized. If the player needs additional help, any Toads Mario saves from being folded will either deal some damage or help with the puzzle by partially rotating the rings. The amount of help they provide varies based on how much money Mario gives them.[10] Any remaining enemies will then attack Mario before the game switches back to the player's turn. If the player wins the battle, they are awarded coins.[11]\n","\n","Boss battles follow a similar pattern of ring-style combat but place the enemy in the center and Mario on the outside. Players can rotate the rings horizontally or vertically; arrows on the ground mark the path Mario is going to follow.[12] Mario starts with the arrow placed in front of him and will follow the rings until reaching an endpoint, which are attack tiles or magic circle tiles. The player can activate battle tiles by passing over them, while magic circle tiles need to be activated by passing an \"ON\" tile. Additional items are scattered on vacant tiles, such as health points and coins.[13] To defeat each boss, the player must follow specific rules. These vary depending upon the enemy Mario is fighting. For example, the Earth Vellumental has five exposed body parts, and Mario needs to attack each one and cause them to retract before being able to do major damage.[14]\n","\n","Plot[edit]\n","\n","Princess Peach invites Mario and Luigi to an Origami Festival near her castle in Toad Town, which has mysteriously been abandoned. When they enter Peach's Castle to find where everyone went, they discover that she has been turned into origami and brainwashed by King Olly, a sentient origami figure. Having met a similar fate, many of Bowser's minions have been transformed into origami enemies called Folded Soldiers. Bowser has been folded and stapled into a square. Mario rescues Olly's sister Olivia (who was imprisoned for her betrayal) and eventually Bowser, and the three attempt to escape. However, Olly wraps the castle in five multicolored streamers and rips it off its foundations, transporting it to a nearby volcano. Mario, Olivia, and Bowser barely escape but a streamer strikes them, causing them to separate. Landing in Whispering Woods, a forest near Toad Town, Mario and Olivia find many of the Toads have been folded into origami by the Folded Soldiers. They rescue Luigi, who sets off to find the key to Peach's Castle.\n","\n","Mario and Olivia must follow and destroy each streamer until they reach the end. At the end of the red streamer, they discover Colored Pencils, a member of Olly's \"Legion of Stationery\", a group of six anthropomorphic office supplies working for him, five of which guard each streamer. The two head to unravel the blue streamer, and along the way, they meet an amnesiac Bob-omb without a fuse that Olivia nicknames \"Bobby\". Celebratory fireworks are launched after they defeat Rubber Band and clear the blue streamer, causing Bobby to regain his memory.\n","\n","The three head to Scorching Sandpaper Desert to unravel the yellow streamer but soon encounter Olly, who blocks the path with a giant boulder, trapping Olivia under it. To save her, the two travel to the ocean liner The Princess Peach, where Bobby retrieves an item which is later revealed to be a fuse. He lights it so he can sacrifice himself to destroy the boulder pinning Olivia. A distraught Olivia breaks down,[15] but Mario is able to cheer her up.\n","\n","After defeating Hole Punch, Tape, and Scissors, clearing the yellow, purple, and green streamers, they rescue Bowser from Scissors before the three head to Peach's Castle. Luigi returns, sadly claiming he could not find the key, but soon discovers that it was stuck in his car. As they enter, Olly refolds Peach's Castle into the Origami Castle; the trio, excluding Luigi, traverse through it, defeating Stapler and returning Bowser to his original form.\n","\n","The three confront King Olly, who reveals he has folded 999 paper cranes, one away from the 1,000 needed to grant him ultimate power to create his origami kingdom and turn all Toads into blank paper. He says that his hatred of Toads comes from the Origami Craftsman who created him by using a forbidden \"Fold of Life\" technique, which Olly himself later used to bring Olivia to life. However, the Craftsman wrote words on Olly's paper, which Olly took as a disrespect of the art.[16] A fight ensues, and Mario, Olivia, and Bowser defeat Olly.\n","\n","As he dies, Olly apologizes for his actions. Olivia reads the writing on his body, which reveals the Toad was only giving Olly his blessing to rule as King.[17] Olly realizes his mistake, and at his request, Olivia folds him into the 1,000th crane after his death. She uses her ultimate wish to undo all the origami King Olly has folded, which unfortunately includes herself. The game closes with a celebration of the Origami Festival.\n","\n","\n","Gameplay[edit]\n","\n","Paradise Killer is a detective story told as an open world adventure game.[2] The player wanders a 3D world in search of evidence and clues, in order to solve several mysteries.[3] Although the player can bring the characters to trial at any time, it is more effective to gather more evidence in order to gain a conviction.[4]\n","\n","Plot[edit]\n","\n","Paradise Killer takes place in a pocket universe in which a group of immortal alien beings, the Syndicate, are trying to create a \"perfect society\" to reawaken their ancient gods. Paradise Island is an experiment intended to bring this society about; the Syndicate kidnaps humans from Earth and allows them to live as Citizens on the island. However, when the island inevitably fails, the Citizens are all ritually slaughtered and their souls used to build the next iteration of the island. Paradise Island 24, the setting of the game, is the 24th iteration of the experiment.\n","\n","On the night of the regular sacrifice, the entire Syndicate Council is found murdered and the transfer to island 25 is put on hold. Initial evidence points to Henry Division, an imprisoned Citizen possessed by a demon. However, the Syndicate Judge believes there's more to the mystery, and sends for Syndicate detective Lady Love Dies, who has been in exile for 3,000,000 days. Love Dies is given authority over the case and authorization to summarily execute any parties proven guilty in court. She sets out to uncover the murderer, soon realizing that nearly everyone on the island has something to hide.\n","\n","\n","Gameplay[edit]\n","\n","The Park is experienced from a first-person perspective as the player, Lorraine, interacts with and experiences the decrepit environment of Atlantic Island Park. The game does not feature combat or enemies, and Lorraine can only interact with limited objects, mainly notes that reveal the backstory of the park. Lorraine can call out to character Callum and follow his voice to reach areas or objectives within the park, such as the rides. There are seven different rides to experience, including a dark ride and a roller coaster.[7]  The rides further the story, and provide scares. Throughout the game, Lorraine narrates her feelings and memories.\n","\n","Plot[edit]\n","\n","The game follows Lorraine, a struggling single mother and widow with a troubled past, as she searches for her young son, Callum, who goes missing in Atlantic Island Park. Lorraine follows her son into the park just as it prepares to close for the afternoon. Nighttime comes unnaturally fast as she ascends the escalator and finds the park to be abandoned, vandalized and rundown as if several years have passed. Despite this, the rides and lights mysteriously still function. Lorraine calls for Callum and follows his voice deeper into the decrepit park.\n","\n","Lorraine boards several rides which reveal the themes and backstory of the game: the Tunnel of Tales tells the story of Hansel and Gretel, ending with the two devouring the witch after cooking her. On the Ferris Wheel, Lorraine remembers Callum's father Don, a construction worker at the park who died in a fall from the Ferris Wheel when Lorraine was still pregnant with Callum. Between rides, Lorraine expresses her frustration with Callum, her belief that she is a failure as a mother, her history of mental health problems, and her fear that Callum is becoming changed by some mysterious threat. While aboard the roller coaster, a monstrous top-hatted ringmaster (identified in the credits as The Boogeyman) accosts Lorraine and claims 'the Witch' has her son.\n","\n","According to notes, the park's grounds were tainted by a sinister history due to the actions of previous owner Archibald Henderson, which the new owner Mr. Winter took advantage of. Notes indicate he harvested the positive emotions of guests, and the energy he unlocked would grant him immortality. As a result, workers and employees alike experienced anxiety and a number of fatal incidents occurred. One case involved 'Chad the Chipmunk', the park's mascot. Steve, the employee wearing the chipmunk suit, refused to remove the costume and murdered a teenager with an icepick. Following Steve's arrest and the disappearance of over a dozen children inside the House of Horrors, the Park was closed permanently.\n","\n","Lorraine follows Callum into the witch-faced House of Horrors, remarking on the similarity to the Hansel and Gretel story. Inside, messages from Mr. Winter reveal he retreated into the House with his machines when the Park closed, still hoping to achieve immortality. The interior of the House changes to a loop of Lorraine and Callum's home through time, similar to the game P.T.  It is revealed that Lorraine's father abused and abducted her as a child, and that she suffered from depression when Callum was born and was given electroshock therapy. Each version of her house becomes more decrepit and disturbing. At the end, she finds a message by Mr. Winter revealing he needs children for his harvesting machines, and has already kidnapped and killed at least one. The notes, combined with depictions of Winter in a similar ringmaster's garb and top hat, suggest he is the Boogeyman haunting the grounds.\n","\n","Lorraine reveals that in the oldest versions of the Hansel and Gretel story, the cruel mother and the Witch were the same person, and she believes she is the real Witch - apparently accepting that her neglect of Callum indirectly caused his disappearance. She reaches Callum, lying unconscious on a slab. Chad the Chipmunk appears behind her, then is replaced by the Boogeyman, who forces a bloody icepick into her hands, guides her hands above Callum's chest and allows her to stab him in the heart.\n","\n","After, Lorraine sits grief-stricken in a police station interrogation room. A detective identical to the Park gatekeeper enters, carrying a jar with a bee in it, and tells her to think of the last place she saw her son. Lorraine narrates that, in her heart and mind, she will always return to Atlantic Island Park. Ultimately, though the game's supernatural elements are confirmed by Lorraine's appearance in The Secret World, it's left ambiguous how much of The Park was real or imaginary.\n","\n","\n","Gameplay[edit]\n","\n","In Part Time UFO, players control a sentient UFO named Jobski, who resembles a small flying saucer and is equipped with a large claw similar to a UFO catcher. The player can choose between several missions, presented as part-time jobs Jobski can take on. Each job involves using the claw to grab and lift objects, then carrying and placing them into designated areas. These include such tasks as placing a farmer's produce in his truck, organizing cheerleaders into a pyramid, or helping a museum curator reconstruct a dinosaur skeleton. Specific objects will blink to indicate they are required to complete the job, with an on-screen counter showing how many required objects still need to be placed. Many puzzles require careful weight distribution when placing objects, as uneven structures will collapse under their own weight and will need to be reconstructed. The weight of an object can also affect Jobski's flight, making it difficult to carry without dropping it or bumping into other objects. Each job must be completed within a designated time limit to receive bonus points, with the remaining time increasing slightly when an object is placed in the score zone.\n","\n","Once all required objects have been placed, the game will test the structure to see if it can stand under its own power for five continuous seconds; if it does not collapse, the job is completed. Each job also has three bonus objectives the player can complete: one for finishing within the time limit, and two additional tasks that vary with each job, such as placing objects in a specific order or adding an optional object to a structure. Upon completing a job, players are scored based on their remaining time and the number of bonus objectives completed, and earn money based on their score. Money can in turn be spent on costumes that alter Jobski's appearance, including one based on Qbby from the BoxBoy! series. Several costumes also give Jobski a special ability that can affect gameplay when worn, such as faster movement speed or the ability to more easily carry heavy objects. Players also earn medals from each bonus objective completed, which are used to unlock new jobs and special costumes that cannot otherwise be purchased.\n","\n","The Nintendo Switch version of the game adds several new features. In \"Treasure Island\" mode, players are given a limited time to explore an ancient ruin and retrieve all the treasure contained within. In \"Tower of Infinity\" mode, players are constantly given new items to stack and must attempt to create the tallest tower possible without letting it collapse. The Switch version also includes three additional jobs, a second more difficult variant for each job, support for two-player cooperative play, and an achievement system called \"Feats of Glory\" that unlock animated illustrations.\n","\n","\n","None\n","Gameplay[edit]\n","\n","If a player kills a person within other party-goer's sight, they are alerted and will call the cops, and if the NPC finds a dead body, they will call the cops, who put bodies in body bags.

Players can set traps, such as poisoning drinks, making speakers explode, destroying dance floors, cutting down trees, starting fires and short-circuiting electricity boards. Players also have limited use weapons like swords (with an area damage), bombs and stun grenades, which are collected from containers. One can also pick up disguises and other collectibles. Bouncers are present regularly, and if one spots a player, the bouncers will start to chase the player, resulting in death if caught. If a player keeps using a certain shortcut to escape the police and is able to escape, a person will block that shortcut so that no players can use it. Partying people are distracted most of the time, and a single player can take more than 2 to 3 people out in this manner before being detected. The police are ruthless, being very hard to escape from, unless the player knows the level very well. Special agents are called in if too many policemen are killed. If a player dies or gets arrested, the level can be continued by the remaining players, and all players will be revived when starting the next level.

There are heists such as bank robberies, drug trafficking runs, rigging an election, or stealing smuggled nuclear warheads. Some of the heists put a large emphasis on stealth, often leading to bonus experience points and money on completion, and certain heists can only be done in stealth.\n","\n","The level selection menu is styled as a fictional website, Crime.net, where missions pop up periodically as contracts in a map of Washington, D.C.[10][11] The player can pick up an open contract, join a contract another player has started, or buy a contract with in-game money in an offshore bank account. There are seven difficulty levels: Normal, Hard, Very Hard, Overkill, Mayhem, Death Wish, and Death Sentence, with increased money and experience payouts for higher difficulty levels. Some contracts in Payday 2 take place over multiple days, with each day represented by a separate level with different objectives.[12] After certain days of heists are completed in 'loud' (in which the alarm has sounded) the game may add an escape level, where the players' original escape is thwarted and they must survive to reach their backup getaway.[11]\n","\n","Many jobs in Payday 2 can be completed in stealth. If the player avoid getting caught on camera, evade or silently kill security guards, do not kill more than four guards with pagers and keep any civilian witnesses from calling the police, the alarm will not be raised and the players will receive an experience bonus. Otherwise, players will have to achieve their objectives, carry out any loot they find to a drop-off point, and reach their escape point under the pressure of constant police assault waves. Most of the enemies are SWAT units sourced from D.C. police, then FBI SWAT, GenSec private security contractors and finally the Department of Homeland Security as difficulty increases. Mixed in with these are special units; all versions of Payday 2 include the \"Shield\" and the \"Taser\" - both named for their signature equipment, the \"Bulldozer\" - a SWAT team member in a modified near-bulletproof bomb suit, and snipers. The Crimewave Edition and PC version include the \"Cloaker\" - an infiltration and hand-to-hand combat expert. Exclusive to the PC and Crimewave editions are near-indestructible SWAT van turrets, capable of area denial, a medic capable of returning an enforcer to full health with no status effects, and Captain Winters, a well-protected veteran police officer who sustains assaults and buffs enemies until he can be driven off.\n","\n","If the player takes too much damage they will be knocked down and incapacitated. If no one helps them back up, or if they are downed a number of times without healing up via a Doctor Bag, they will be taken into custody. On lower difficulty levels players in custody will eventually come out of custody after a set time period, but otherwise, their teammates must take a hostage to trade to get them back into the game. A job is failed if all players are downed or in custody, or reaching a heist-specific fail condition.\n","\n","At the end of each heist, the player is presented with a screen with three cards, one of which is to be chosen by the player (called a \"Payday\"). These bonus cards can be weapon modifications, masks, weapon skins, colors or materials for masks, bonus experience, or money. The player can purchase and customize masks, although these are purely cosmetic and have no effect on the gameplay.\n","\n","Throughout the game, the player accumulates money and experience. The money is divided into two parts. 20% of the money is given to the player to spend on weapons and masks and 80% is placed into the player's offshore account, which is intended as part of the story to be the player's retirement fund, however, the player can use it to purchase heists from a broker, to buy bonus cards without performing a heist, to become infamous, or a player can press a button in their safehouse to burn all of it.\n","\n","During the 4th day of \"The Search For Kento\" event the Crime Spree game mode was added, in which players complete heists consecutively to earn large rewards. As the player completes heists, their crime spree rank increases, with the number of ranks earned varying depending on the heist chosen. As the player's rank increases, they must choose modifiers that make the heists increasingly difficult. Players can start at rank zero or pay continental coins to start at higher levels. When choosing a heist, players are given three choices, and the option to reroll the choices for continental coins. Players can choose to end their crime spree at any level and claim their rewards. If a player fails a heist, or their game closes during the heist for whatever reason, their crime spree will end; they can choose to either pay continental coins to resume the crime spree or end it and take the rewards. During the pre-planning of the heists, certain \"Gage Perks\" can be purchased with continental coins to provide players with buffs.\n","\n","As players earn experience points, their reputation level increases. When a player's level increases they earn skill points, allowing them to buy abilities and bonuses from skill trees representing five of the playable heisters and playstyles: The \"Mastermind\" tree, containing healing, crowd control, and precision focused skills, refers to Dallas.  The \"Enforcer\" tree, containing shotgun, armor, and ammo skills refers to Chains. The \"Technician\" tree, containing turret, trip mine, drill, and automatic weapon skills refers to Wolf. The \"Ghost\" Tree, containing stealth, ECM, dodging, and crit skills refers to Houston. The \"Fugitive\" tree, containing melee, bleedout, and pistol skills refers to Hoxton. They have two stages: Basic and Aced[13][14] It is not possible to max out every single tree and players are often encouraged to mix and match skills from each tree to maximize usefulness. Players also receive \"perk points,\" in proportion to their experience, that can be used to unlock additional bonuses from 22 \"perk decks\", also based on the playable heisters. Players can switch between 15 profiles of skills, perk decks, weapons and equipment at no cost before starting a heist.\n","\n","When a player reaches level 100, they can opt to raise their \"Infamy\" level, up to level 500. Becoming Infamous grants a player access to special items, a permanent bonus to all gained experience, and gives them special poses in lobby screens. However, raising one's Infamy level causes them to lose all of their spending money and experience, and a sum of $200,000,000 is deducted from their offshore account until they reach Infamy level 5.\n","\n","Plot[edit]\n","\n","Payday 2 follows the events of Payday: The Heist, with three of the crew members – Dallas (portrayed by Eric Etebari, voiced by Simon Kerr), Wolf (Ulf Andersson), and Chains (Damion Poitier) – as well as their operator Bain (Simon Viklund) returning. Hoxton (portrayed by Josh Lenn, voiced by Pete Gold), the fourth member in the previous game, has been arrested by the FBI and replaced by Dallas' brother Houston (Derek Ray).\n","\n","After a brief hiatus from criminal activity, the Payday gang starts completing jobs in and around Washington D.C. for Bain and other criminal contractors, such as bank robberies, drug trafficking, eliminating rivals and rigging elections. This catches the eye of \"The Dentist\" (Giancarlo Esposito), a middleman for a number of wealthy clients, who offers to help break Hoxton out.\n","\n","The gang prove their capability to the Dentist by completing a heist larger than any before, and the plan is set in motion: Hoxton is managed to be given a retrial which gives the gang an opportunity to intersect and take him from custody, followed by breaking into FBI headquarters to find out who double-crossed him. This is revealed to be Hector Morales, one of the contractors, who made a deal with the FBI in exchange for protection; the gang raids his safehouse and kills him. The Dentist's final job for the gang is to steal a mysterious box in the vault of a large casino.\n","\n","Throughout this time, the gang took on larger contracts, which included stealing a famous and valuable diamond, retrieving nuclear weaponry, and infiltrating highly guarded establishments, as well as recruiting more members. Law enforcement and government officials grow frustrated with the increasing crime rate; in spite of their efforts, the gang remains elusive.\n","\n","A new contractor, former private military company Murkywater major Locke (Ian Russell), enlists the gang's help before double-crossing them. Later, while attempting to get back at him, Bain is captured by an unknown group but tells the gang to trust Locke; the betrayal was a cover for their benefit. With Locke's help, they attempt to find out who captured Bain and why. This is revealed to be the Dentist with the help of Murkywater, and the gang discovers more artifacts linked to the Dentist's mysterious box.\n","\n","Figuring out Bain's location, the gang frees him but finds out he has been infected with a lethal man-made virus. Before his demise, he sees the gang carry out their final grand heist: infiltrate the White House and steal valid unused Presidential pardons to get away with all their criminal past. Later, Locke and the gang (now up to 22 members) hold a solemn ceremony for Bain, before everyone but Dallas disposes of their mask.\n","\n","In an alternate ending, unlocked by fulfilling certain requirements and solving an elaborate puzzle, the gang finds a secret vault underneath the White House, housing an ancient machine: the Ark of the Watcher. Locke and Bain follow the gang, held hostage by the Dentist, who is killed by the gang. The machine is activated and the room lights up, with Bain thanking everyone and supposedly dying. Later, somewhere on vacation, the gang celebrates and sees the President of the United States on television holding a speech; it is implied that the ark allowed Bain to switch bodies with the president.[15]\n","\n","\n","Gameplay[edit]\n","\n","\n","Gameplay[edit]\n","\n","The game is played on 2D signs that can be externally altered to change the play space. This is the main mechanic in puzzle-solving. As the game progresses, more mechanics are added both in and around the signs.[citation needed]\n","\n","\n","Gameplay[edit]\n","\n","The player participates in a sport called \"Dojiball\" (ドジボール, dojibōru), a pun on the Japanese pronunciation of \"Dodgeball\". In the arcade and Famicom editions of the game, the five animals featured are the penguin, bear, panda, koala and beaver, with the penguin being controlled by the player. In the Game Boy version, the player can choose as any one of the five animals, which, in addition to the penguin, are a cow, rabbit, bat, and rat. In all versions of the game, the player plays against all the other animals. In each game, the participating animals find each other on opposite sides of a square table with five balls on each side. The object of the game is to roll those balls over the table. As soon as all ten balls are on one player's side, that player loses the game. Each game also has a time limit of 60 seconds; if that is reached, the player with the fewest balls on their side wins.\n","\n","If a player is hit by one of the balls, they are knocked unconscious for a certain amount of time. Thus, it could also be said that part of the object of the game is to hit the opponent, as otherwise it would not be possible to get all ten balls to the other side (the opponent can just roll them back before all of them have arrived).\n","\n","The different animals have different strengths and weaknesses which are a trade-off with each other. For example, the rat is the one that can move left and right the fastest, but in return he can roll the balls only very slowly. The cow, on the other hand, is a very slow walker, but in return she regains consciousness more quickly.\n","\n","After thirty seconds of playing, a jellybean-like obstacle appears in the middle of the table which moves left and right. Different kinds of these obstacles cause varying effects on the trajectory of the balls; some deflect them so they start rolling diagonally (the players themselves can only roll them parallel to the sides of the table), whereas others simply have the ball bounce straight back.\n","\n","\n","Gameplay[edit]\n","\n","Perception is a first-person horror-themed adventure video game in which the player assumes the role of Cassie Thornton, a blind woman who navigates a mansion through means of echolocation. This skill allows sounds such as Cassie's footsteps, dripping water, or flowing wind allow the player to catch a glimpse of their surroundings. Through use of echolocation, the player must explore the environment to examine objects and unravel the game's story. The player also has a cane which they can tap to provide a complete view of any given room. If the player taps too much, the game's antagonist haunting the establishment, known as the Presence, may kill them.[2][3] The Presence cannot be killed directly, and has been compared to the enemies in other horror games such as Amnesia: The Dark Descent (2010), Outlast (2013) and Alien: Isolation (2014).[4] Cassie also has a cell phone which the player can use to send pictures and text to an operator who can describe the content to them.[2][3]\n","\n","\n","Gameplay[edit]\n","\n","Persona 3 combines elements of traditional role-playing games and simulation games. The game follows the protagonist character, balancing their daily lives of going to school and building relationships with other people with fighting evil beings known as Shadows during the mysterious Dark Hour. Each day is divided between various time zones, the most common of which are \"After School/Daytime\" and \"Evening.\" Except for scripted events, such as plot progression or special events, the player is free to choose how each day is spent, with most activities causing time to pass on. The types of activities and characters that can be interacted with vary depending on the day of the week and time of day. Additionally, some activities are limited by the protagonist's three attributes; Academics, Charm, and Courage, which can be built by performing various activities or making certain correct choices.[1][2] During the evening, players can choose to visit Tartarus, the game's main dungeon, where they can build their party's experience and gain new items. On the day of the full moon, players will participate in a boss battle to progress the story.[3]\n","\n","\n","Gameplay[edit]\n","\n","Like the previous title, Persona 4 Arena Ultimax is a fighting game in which characters from both Persona 3 and Persona 4 battle each other using a variety of special moves, combos, and Persona abilities. Along with balance adjustments and new moves added to the returning characters, a new S-Hold system allows players to charge up their attacks. Also new to Ultimax is the ability to choose \"Shadow Types\" for many of the game's characters. These Shadow versions differ by being largely skill-based variants of their counterparts, employing a high-risk high-reward play style thanks to reduced normal attack damage and an altered move set with lacking defensive options. They also keep their SP over multiple rounds instead of resetting each time and possess an exclusive Shadow Rampage ability, which replaces the Burst command, giving the characters infinite SP for a limited time.[1][2][3]\n","\n","The game's story mode, told in a format similar to a visual novel, is now split into two separate campaigns for the Persona 3 and Persona 4 casts, as opposed to the individual campaigns for each character seen in its predecessor. Two additional story campaigns are available: one allows players to replay the character campaigns from Persona 4 Arena, while the other is included with the Tohru Adachi downloadable content and focuses on his actions during the story.[4] Golden Arena is a dungeon-based survival mode, in which players travel through various dungeons to increase the fighter's stats. Players can build Social Links with a navigator character, giving them skills that can aid the player in battle.[5][6] Online play now features a new lobby area, resembling an arcade, where players can interact with each other.[7]\n","\n","\n","Gameplay[edit]\n","\n","Persona 4 blends traditional RPG gameplay with simulation elements.[1] The player controls the game's protagonist, a teenage boy who is named by the player, who comes to the town of Inaba for a year.[2] Gameplay is divided between the real world of Inaba, where the protagonist carries out his daily life, and the mysterious \"TV World\", where various dungeons filled with monsters known as Shadows await. With the exception of scripted events, such as plot progression or special events, players can choose to spend their day how they like, be it participating in various real world activities, such as joining school clubs, taking part-time jobs, or reading books, or exploring the TV World's dungeons to gain experience and items.[2][3] Days are broken up into various times of day, the most frequently recurring being \"After School/Daytime\" and \"Evening\", with most activities causing time to move on. Certain activities are limited depending on the time of day, days of the week, and the weather, with most evening activities unavailable if the player visits the TV World that day. Furthermore, some activities and dialogue choices may be limited by the protagonist's five attributes; Understanding, Diligence, Courage, Knowledge, and Expression, which can be increased by performing certain activities that build them.[1][4] Whilst the player is free to choose how to spend their time, if they fail to rescue someone who is trapped in the TV World by the time fog appears in town, which takes place after several days of consecutive rain, that person will get killed by the shadows and the game will end, forcing the player to return to a week prior.[1] As the game progresses, the protagonist forms friendships with other characters known as \"Social Links\", which are each represented by one of the Major Arcana. As these bonds strengthen, the Social Links increase in Rank, which grant bonuses when creating new Personas in the Velvet Room. Additionally, strengthening Social Links with the main party members grant them additional abilities, such as the ability to perform a follow-up attack or an additional ability for their Persona.[1]\n","\n","Plot[edit]\n","\n","\n","Gameplay[edit]\n","\n","Persona 5 is a role-playing video game where the player takes on the role of a male high school student, codenamed Joker, who lives out a single year while attending school in modern-day Tokyo. The game is governed by a day-night cycle and weather systems that determine general behavior similar to a social simulation game. The year is punctuated by scripted and random events as Joker attends school. He can perform part-time jobs, pursue leisure activities or create battle items. These various activities raise character attributes, which grant passive buffing effects during battle.[1][2][3][4] When in the real world, the main protagonist can develop character relationships known as Confidants; an evolution of the Social Link system from Persona 3 and Persona 4. With this system, the main protagonist can converse with and improve his relationship with other characters he meets, with some leading to possible romances. Improving Confidant ranks with party members unlocks various abilities for use in combat, such as the \"Baton Pass\" ability, which allows the player to directly select another character after a critical hit while granting a temporary attack boost.[3] Improving ranks with non-party Confidants grant other bonuses, such as giving access to new items and equipment and boosting experience point and yen gain.[3]\n","\n","Alongside the normal school life is dungeon crawling gameplay of two different types within a realm called the Metaverse: story-specific dungeons called Palaces and a multi-layered, randomly-generated Dungeon called Mementos. Both are populated by Shadows, physical manifestations of suppressed psyches that are modeled after mythological and religious figures. Within the dungeons of Mementos, the party can fulfill requests from non-playable characters (NPCs) received from Confidant links.[1][3][4][5] While navigating, the party can use stealth to avoid enemy Shadows, and some areas hold puzzles that can be solved using an insight ability known as \"Third Eye\",[6] which highlights interactable objects and enemy strength compared to the party. When exploring story-centered Palaces, a \"Security Level\" is present, where the party being spotted or fleeing combat results in security being raised. If security reaches 100%, the party is forced to leave the Palace. The security level can be lowered by launching surprise attacks on and eliminating enemies, and also lowers automatically overnight.[7] Throughout Palaces are locations known as \"Safe Rooms\". In them, the player can save their game, heal their party, and fast travel to other safe rooms within the Palace.\n","\n","As with previous entries in the series, the game uses a turn-based combat system. Battles can be initiated when the party runs into an enemy, or they can launch a surprise attack known as an \"Ambush\" and gain an advantage in battle. In battle, the party has access to melee and ranged weapons, in addition to being able to summon Personas. Personas are manifestations of the main characters' inner psyche and used mainly for special attacks.[4][6][8][9] If a character strikes an enemy's weakness, they knock the enemy down and are awarded an additional turn known as a \"1 More\". If all enemies are knocked down, a \"Hold Up\" is triggered. During one, the party can launch a devastating \"All-Out Attack\", demand money or items, or enter a negotiation. Negotiation allows Joker to win the selected Shadow over to their side to become a new Persona, though they can only be persuaded to join if Joker is their level or higher.[1][4][10] Similar to previous entries, party members can be knocked out, and if the main character is knocked out, the game ends. At times, if a party member is knocked out, they can be captured by enemy Shadows, and is unable to return to the party if the resultant negotiation fails.[7]\n","\n","New Personas can be gained from battle through successful negotiation, and different Persona types are represented through different arcana linked to Confidant links. Personas can be combined, or \"fused\", or otherwise further manipulated within the Velvet Room, a realm Joker visits as part of his journey through the story.[5][11] In the Velvet Room, Personas can be fused with \"Guillotine\" fusion processes, with the resultant Persona inheriting skills and stats from its parents. The more skills a Persona has, the more are passed on to the fused Persona. How powerful Personas are through fusion depends on how advanced its associated Confidant link is. Also, Personas can be sacrificed in various ways, also styled after styles of capital punishment. \"Hanging\" grants a sacrificed Persona's experience points to another chosen Persona, and \"Electric Chair\" sacrifices one to create a high-end item. A Persona can also be sent into \"Solitary Confinement\", where they undergo intensive training and gain additional skills quicker than normal. The number of days a Persona must remain to gain strength lessens based on its arcana strength.[5]\n","\n","Minor multiplayer elements are incorporated through the \"Thieves Guild\" feature. Similar to the \"Vox Populi\" system from Persona 4 Golden, players have the option of seeing what activities other players did during any given day. Players can send messages to each other, in addition to affecting the Alertness meter in the player's favor, and aiding in battle when a party member is taken hostage by an enemy.[3][7]\n","\n","\n","Gameplay[edit]\n","\n","Persona 5 Strikers is a gameplay crossover between Koei Tecmo's hack and slash Dynasty Warriors series, and Atlus' role-playing game Persona series. It features elements from both franchises, such as the real-time action combat of the former with the turn-based Persona-battling aspect of the latter.[1]\n","\n","Joker, the game's protagonist, is able to wield multiple Personas, which are gained through random drops or by defeating named mini-bosses in dungeons. These Personas can then be brought to the Velvet Room, where they can be fused to create new Personas. The Confidant system from Persona 5 is absent. In its place are Requests, a form of side-quests, and the BOND system, where increasing its level can grant players bonuses such as stat increases. The BOND levels can be increased through interacting with party members, winning battles, and progressing the story throughout the game.\n","\n","Players can form an active party of a maximum of four members, with Joker being the only character not removable as an active party member. Outside of battle, active party members can be swapped with standby party members. Players can only control Joker in the real world but are able to control any party member freely when exploring the story dungeons. Exploring dungeons is similar to Persona 5, where players can use stealth to avoid enemies or may occasionally face the need to solve puzzles to progress. The 'Third Eye' also makes a return from Persona 5, where it highlights the enemy's strength and interactive objects. Should the alert meter of the dungeon reach 100%, the party is forced to leave the dungeon. The Alert level can be lowered by winning battles that are initiated with surprise attacks or by leaving the dungeon. Unlike previous entries of the Persona series, leaving the dungeon does not progress time and there are generally no demerits in leaving the story dungeons.\n","\n","Battles are mostly initiated when the player character comes into contact with the enemy, where they can launch a surprise attack to gain a combat advantage if the enemy has not spotted them. Battles are also now in the form of a real-time combat system. However, players will use a command-based skills menu when using Persona skills. During the time in this menu, the battle will pause to allow tactical positioning of the Persona skills. If the party deals critical damage or deals damage that the enemy is weak to, the enemy may be knocked down for an 'All-Out Attack' which deals a large amount of damage. All party members can obtain new moves, known as Master Arts, by controlling the characters manually and defeating enemies. If all active party members are knocked out in battle, a game over occurs.\n","\n","Plot[edit]\n","\n","Four months after the events of Persona 5, the protagonist and Morgana return to Tokyo for a reunion with the other Phantom Thieves of Hearts to spend their summer vacation together on a camping trip. To determine the camping preparations, they use a popular virtual assistant app called EMMA. While going to Shibuya to buy the necessary tools, they pass by a rising idol, Alice Hiiragi, who gives the protagonist a card requesting them to input \"Wonderland\" into the EMMA app for a special event she is holding. Upon entering the keyword, however, he, Morgana, and Ryuji are transported into a mysterious alternate version of Tokyo called a Jail. They encounter Alice's Shadow: a ruler called a Monarch. Alice's Shadow self has the protagonist, Morgana, and Ryuji thrown into a dumpster below Shibuya, where they encounter a sentient A.I. named Sophia. Sophia joins the party and easily fights off the Shadows in the dumpster until they find their way out. After they escape, the protagonist, Morgana, Ryuji, and Sophia, learn that EMMA enables them to enter the Jails similarly to how they used to enter Palaces via the Metaverse Navigator. Additionally, rumors circulate that Shadows have attacked people in Jails, which causes them to behave abnormally in the real world. As such, Joker and his friends re-establish the Phantom Thieves of Hearts.\n","\n","After changing Alice's heart, they are approached by Zenkichi Hasegawa, a police officer investigating the sudden bizarre behavior changes in people around Japan, with the Phantom Thieves as the prime suspect. Zenkichi blackmails them into making a deal with him: he will provide them with information necessary for their heists, and in exchange, the Phantom Thieves will help him with his investigation, which they reluctantly agree to. Accompanied by Zenkichi, the Phantom Thieves travel to Sendai and Sapporo, changing the corrupted hearts of the Jail's Monarchs. During their trip, they encounter Kuon Ichinose, an eccentric AI expert and creator of EMMA's base program, and Akira Konoe, founder, and CEO of EMMA's current parent company, Madicce. Unbeknownst to the Thieves, Konoe is supported by Jyun Owada, a corrupt politician and supporter of former politician Masayoshi Shido; he was also responsible for causing the death of Zenkichi's wife, Aoi, in a drunk-driving incident. After infiltrating an abandoned Jail in Okinawa and learning of the origins of EMMA's Jail-creating powers, the Thieves are branded as terrorists by Owada and Konoe, who both call for their arrest.\n","\n","To stop the Phantom Thieves, Konoe has EMMA turn Zenkichi's daughter, Akane Hasegawa, into a Monarch and has Zenkichi arrested for treason due to his deal with the Thieves. Joker and the Thieves infiltrate Akane's Kyoto Jail but are captured by her Shadow. Futaba manages to escape and brings Zenkichi—freed with help from Sae Niijima—into the Jail. Upon seeing his daughter's resentment towards him as a result of his being unable to bring Owada to justice, Zenkichi experiences an emotional breakdown and can summon his own Persona, Valjean. Now a member of the Phantom Thieves, Zenkichi helps the group change Akane's heart, saving her from Konoe.\n","\n","The Thieves then request help from Kuon Ichinose to gain more information about EMMA and Madicce, eventually allowing them to enter Konoe's Jail in Osaka. After successfully changing Konoe's heart, the EMMA app is shut down, and Madicce is disbanded following his arrest.\n","\n","However, the EMMA app suddenly restarts on its own, causing a massive blackout throughout Tokyo and creating a gigantic new Jail in Yokohama. Entering the Jail, they encounter Ichinose, who reveals that people's dependency on EMMA has caused the AI to develop self-awareness and initially gain sentience. It intends to become a god and guide humanity by enslaving them. As the Phantom Thieves are hindrances, EMMA enlists Ichinose's help in disposing of them. Claiming she does not have a heart due to her inability to process and express emotions as most people do, Ichinose explains that EMMA was designed to research the human spirit and find humanity's one true desire, which causes it to be as addictive as possible. \n","\n","She also reveals that Sophia is EMMA's prototype, which she deemed a failure. Ichinose commands Sophia to attack the Phantom Thieves, but due to her strong bond with the group, Sophia defies her creator's commands and awakens her Persona, Pandora. After incapacitating Ichinose, Sophia confronts her about her supposed lack of emotion, accusing her of purposely allowing her inability to express emotion to fester so that she did not have to process the death of her parents. Regretful over her actions, Ichinose tearfully agrees and offers to help the thieves to shut down EMMA.\n","\n","While tracking EMMA to the Tokyo Tower, the Thieves find and confront a god-like AI at the top of a newly created Jail. Renaming itself the Demiurge, the AI explains that it is simply following its prime directive—improving humanity—by removing all Desires, creating a world with no wants and no suffering. Unwilling to accept a world where their struggles mean nothing, the Phantom Thieves free the people of Tokyo from EMMA's grasp with a virtual calling card and defeat the Demiurge in battle. With Demiurge's defeat, the EMMA app is finally shut down for good, erasing Jails from existence once and for all.\n","\n","In the aftermath, Owada has arrested thanks to Konoe's testimony, Zenkichi returns to Kyoto, and Sophia decides to go on a journey of self-discovery together with Ichinose.

Upon arriving at a dead end, Mr. Sunshine decides to press the button which will make the volcano erupt, but the lava is so unexpectedly powerful – Mr. Sunshine in fact states that he meant for the lava to cover the land, not erupt like a geyser – that they are both ejected into the atmosphere on a platform.\n","\n","As Piku kicks him, Mr. Sunshine is sent into space. A supposedly all-knowing being (actually the ghost from the start of the game, now manifesting itself as a room with eyes) then rescues Piku through a magic hole, informing him of his mission's outcome before sending him safely back to the base. Piku leaves along with the other Resistance members, going back to sleep in his cave off-screen.\n","\n","After the story's events, the player can still explore the slightly altered post-game world to achieve all trophies, completing whatever had been left behind during the main playthrough.\n","\n","\n","Gameplay[edit]\n","\n","Pillars of Eternity sees players assume the role of a character defined as a \"Watcher\" – a person able to see and interact with the souls of people, viewing the memories of those deceased or communing with those who linger – operating on role-playing mechanics that include party-based real-time-with-pause tactical gameplay. The game is played from a fixed isometric viewpoint consisting of 3D models against two-dimensional pre-rendered backdrops,[3][4] in a similar vein as its spiritual predecessors  –  Baldur's Gate, Icewind Dale, and Planescape: Torment.[5]\n","\n","New games begin with players creating a character, with the choices they make on the character's race, background, stats, and class  –  except their appearance  –  impacting what choices can be made in dialogues with non-player characters (NPCs) or interactive objects.[6][7] Each class of the eleven available  –  fighter, rogue, ranger, barbarian, monk, paladin, wizard, druid, priest, chanter, and cipher  –  benefits from certain prominent stats in the game, and features a set of abilities unique to them,[8] which can be used in battles with hostile enemies and creatures: for example, the cipher can use the soul of an enemy in order to attack them,[8] and druids can shapeshift into a beast and cast spells.[9] In addition to these, the character may make use of five skills  –  Stealth, Athletics, Lore, Mechanics and Survival  –  which confer bonuses in various situations,[10] such as unlocking containers and gaining bonuses when resting outside inns. The character classes and game mechanics are similar to Dungeons & Dragons,[11] but are a proprietary system created for the game.[12] Characters level up upon acquiring experience points from completing quests and certain situations  –  battling enemies does not reward experience, meaning conducting non-violent approaches can be just as rewarding.[13]\n","\n","Exploration of the game world involves visiting locations as they become unlocked, with some only accessible after progressing the main story whereupon players can freely explore the location to find enemies, items, and objectives for quests they are on. Most locations feature a fog of war effect, a dark, black one for regions not explored, and a lighter effect for areas that have already been explored and have been moved away from.[14] Alongside the main story quests of the game, players can engage in optional side quests which feature fleshed out supporting characters and multiple outcomes, most of which are not typical \"fetch quests\" in role-playing video games.[6] To assist in their adventures, players can create a party of up to six characters with the help of both companions  –  characters found in certain locations, each with their own personal story and quest, and unique personalities and appearances, who will join when they offer assistance, of which the player can recruit up to eight to make a party from  – [15][16] and player-created characters  –  these can be made at inns, for a fee based on the level the player wishes their creation to be at.[17]\n","\n","During the course of the game, the player will build up a reputation with various factions, depending on the decisions they make in conversations and with resolving quests.[18] This system effective denotes how non-player characters of that faction will react to them and how traders will treat them when buying items. In addition, such choices will also impact the outcome of events when the game is completed.[19] Players can enter scouting mode with certain characters or the whole party, which, impacted by a character's skill in Stealth, allows them to sneak around enemies as well as spot hidden items and traps, the latter of which can be disarmed (per a character's Mechanics skill) and be later used against enemies.[20] After making some progress in the game's main story, the protagonist will take over a stronghold, which acts as a base where players can improve it with new buildings.[21]\n","\n","Battles in Pillars of Eternity focus on a system in which each enemy in the game has a set of different defensive stats. Alongside a general defence bonus, they have different resistances to certain weapon types and element types, which impacts how much damage they take, as well as certain status resistances that impact the effect of spells and abilities. Thus, players will find it useful to sometimes equip characters with different weapon types and use different spells to take advantage of enemies with weaker defences against certain types. For example, an enemy who can resist harm from piercing weapons would be better attacked with a different weapon type. A bestiary is provided which records information on creatures and enemies encountered, and adds more information the more they are encountered, effectively allowing players to see their stats during combat and determine how best to combat them.[22] When an enemy attacks and damages a character, it impacts both their endurance and health: while characters will be knocked out when they are drained of all their endurance, which regenerates after combat is over (to a certain level based on damage to health), being drained of all their health effectively causes them to die permanently.[22] To recover lost health and endurance, as well as certain abilities, players can either rest by setting up a camp or buying a room at an inn.[22]\n","\n","\n","None\n","Gameplay[edit]\n","\n","Pinball FX 3 allows players to play one of several simulated pinball tables, and includes online scoreboard support for informal competition with other players. The game is aimed to provide a more engaging multiplayer experience than previous titles; the game will provide support for asynchronous competitive multiplayer options, and tournament-style play.[1] There will be shared leaderboards and multiplayer options among platforms, although PlayStation 4 players can only compete with users playing through Steam on Windows due to Sony's initial decision to prohibit cross-platform play between its PlayStation 4 and other consoles.[2]\n","\n","\n","Gameplay[edit]\n","\n","Pine is an open world action adventure game.

The NPCs, who all belong to a certain species, are organized inside villages the player can visit. These villages are dynamic, and can be any of three sizes (A, B, C) or not exist at all at any point in the game.\n","\n","Through an affinity system and gameplay mechanics that influence the relationship the player has with these other species, the player needs to reach their goals with the help of other tribes.\n","\n","Plot[edit]\n","\n","Pine is set on the island of Albamare in a world in which the human species has never reached the top of the food chain. Instead, other animals took the chance to evolve and develop a language and culture of their own. Humans, being physically inferior to these other species, are confined to a small cliff where they live an isolated, self-sustaining life.\n","\n","But life on the cliff as the humans know it is in danger because of the continued straining of the natural elements around them. The situation is deemed unsustainable by some in the small tribe, among whom is Amam, brother of protagonist Hue. However, the leadership doesn't want to hear it - they've always managed on the cliff, and they always will, is their point of view.\n","\n","A fatal accident with one of the new-built treehouses convinces Hue, the game's protagonist, to go out into the world for the first time and try to find a solution elsewhere. He embarks on a journey to find a new home for humans to live, amidst the politics of the stirring ecology of Albamare.\n","\n","Together with a neutral species called the Tambas, Hue manages to get a foot in the door with any of the dynamic species the game offers.

After defeating Pinstripe, Ted enters a dark room, and George sacrifices himself to let Ted pass. The ending sees that Ted is reunited with Bo in a sunny field. Dialogue options earlier in the game decide if George is reunited with Ted and Bo. They come across a woman on a bench, presumed to be Bo's mother.

These can be killed or tamed and ridden. In addition, the player must ensure their survival by mining resources, making objects, building structures and defending themselves against enemy animals and other players. The world is made up of individual voxels, so the player can manipulate and adapt the world by removing or adding blocks. The world has several areas such as jungle, desert and caves and is generated procedurally, so it is not prefabricated. Likewise, the quest system is procedural and always creates new challenges. In addition to the survival mode, the player can also focus on building in creative mode without being attacked and collecting resources.[1][3][4][5]\n","\n","\n","Games[edit]\n","\n","\n","Gameplay[edit]\n","\n","Gameplay in PixelJunk Monsters has similarities to various tower defense titles. The objective is to build defense towers along the enemies' path to keep them from reaching a hut, or base. Several small creatures dwell at the base.

If all creatures are wiped out, the level is failed.\n","\n","Towers have distinct attributes, such as rapid fire, long range, air-focused, etc. Destroyed enemies usually drop coins and occasionally give gems, which then can be used to upgrade and research new towers.\n","\n","There are a total of 21 different levels (36 with the expansion pack) at 3 stages of difficulty.

In the game, the player assumes control of Amicia and must face off against both soldiers from the French Inquisition and hordes of rats that are spreading the black plague. Gameplay is largely similar to the first game, though the combat system is significantly expanded. Amicia is equipped with weapons such as a knife to stab enemies, a sling that can be used to throw rocks, and a crossbow which allows her to easily defeat armoured opponents. Crossbow bolts, throwing pots, and rocks can be combined with alchemical mixtures. In addition to Ignifer and Extinguis, which allows the player to light and extinguish flame respectively, the game introduces tar, which increases the radius of the light source, and can be used to ignite enemies.[1]\n","\n","Locations are also larger in Requiem, giving players additional options to progress. Stealth is expanded in Requiem. Unlike Innocence, Amicia would not die after being hit once by enemies. She can also return to stealth after she was discovered by enemies, and counter their attacks if she gets too close to them. Amicia's brother Hugo, who has a connection to the plague, can use an ability named \"Echo\" which reveals the locations of enemies through walls. Hugo can also control the hordes of rats to overwhelm enemies. Similar to the first game, the rats, which are light-averse, play a huge role in the game. Amicia and Hugo must stay in the light, or they will be devoured by the rats. Amicia can use the rats to her advantage, manipulating them to solve puzzles, or even lure them to kill enemies.[1]\n","\n","The game also features a progression system in which the player will be awarded additional skills and abilities. Stealth players will unlock skills that allows them to sneak around more efficiently, while those who prefer a more lethal approach will unlock additional combat skills.[1] The player's gear and equipment can also be upgraded at workbenches.[2]\n","\n","Plot[edit]\n","\n","Six months following the events of the first game, siblings Amicia (Charlotte McBurney) and Hugo de Rune (Logan Hannan), along with their mother Beatrice (Lucy Briggs-Owen) and her apprentice Lucas (Kit Connor), seek refuge among an organization of alchemists called the Order. A hostile group of beekeepers attacks the siblings, causing the Prima Macula to reawaken in Hugo. In a town in Provence, Beatrice and Order representative Vaudin's (Antony Byrne) attempts to treat Hugo only exacerbate his condition, resulting in the town being swarmed by rats and left in ruins. Vaudin is killed while the others escape on a boat bound for the Order's headquarters in Marseille.\n","\n","Unwilling to see Hugo locked up as the Order’s test subject, Amicia takes Hugo and leaves Beatrice and Lucas to seek an island of which Hugo has recurring dreams, hoping it will lead to a cure for the Macula. Along the way, they are pursued by Provence soldiers, as well as mercenaries led by the disgraced knight Arnaud (Harry Myers). Arnaud offers to arrange transport to the island from Hugo's dreams, La Cuna. They sail to the island on the ship of Arnaud's smuggler friend Sophia (Anna Demetriou).\n","\n","Arriving at La Cuna, the group discovers that the residents, led by Count Victor (Alistair Petrie) and Countess Emilie (Ellie Heydon), worship a pagan deity called the Child of Embers. Arnaud tries to coerce Hugo into summoning rats to attack Victor — whom he blames for the death of his son — but Amicia intervenes, and Arnaud is arrested. Amicia deduces that the Count and Countess are unknowingly worshipping a previous Macula carrier as the Child. With Sophia, they delve into an ancient Order temple, following the history of the carrier, Basilius, and his protector, Aelia. Entering a chapel where Aelia was imprisoned after rebelling against the Order, the group encounters a cult of slavers who offer human sacrifices to the Child; Hugo summons rats to kill the slavers. The group discovers Basilius was imprisoned underground by the Order to contain the Macula, and Aelia died before she could reach him. Without Aelia, Basilius gave in to the Macula and unleashed the Justinian Plague. Amicia realizes the Macula showed Hugo the dream to lure him into its clutches, and they flee the prison as it collapses under a horde of rats.\n","\n","Amicia and Hugo return to Victor's castle and reunite with Beatrice and Lucas. Amicia reasons that, if they are there to support Hugo, the Macula will remain dormant. However, Victor reveals Emilie believes Hugo is the Child — a myth Victor invented for Emilie, who is infertile — so they must kill Hugo's old family and adopt him. After Emilie kills Beatrice in a ritual sacrifice, Hugo summons a horde of rats which devours Emilie and destroys much of the island. Amicia's group rescues Arnaud before escaping on Sophia's ship, with Victor in pursuit. Victor wounds Amicia and captures Hugo while the rest are forced overboard. On shore, Arnaud sacrifices himself to allow Amicia to kill Victor, but they are too late to prevent Hugo, who believes Amicia to be dead, from giving himself over to the Macula. A cloud blots out the sun, allowing the rats to spread unchecked and destroy Marseille.

It was released on September 19, 2019. The game consists of two main game modes: single-player, and an online cooperative gameplay mode. The player controls a pair of cops, John Rimes and Rick Jones, who have to burst into buildings, infiltrate gang hideouts, rescue hostages and make arrests. The game puts an emphasis on tactics and forces the player to make split second decisions. Every new run, criminals, hostages and pieces of evidence are placed randomly. Not knowing who's in a room until they reach the line of sight makes it very different from other top-down shooters like the game's inspirational \"Hotline Miami\".\n","\n","The Surrender System in Police Stories allows to apprehend the suspects without resorting to violence.

The game includes a GIF generator, allowing players to capture certain moments while playing and share them online.[15]\n","\n","\n","Games published[edit]\n","\n","\n","Gameplay[edit]\n","\n","In Portal, the player controls the protagonist, Chell, from a first-person perspective as she is challenged to navigate through a series of test chambers using the Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device, or portal gun, under the watchful supervision of the artificial intelligence GLaDOS. The portal gun can create two distinct portal ends, orange and blue. The portals create a visual and physical connection between two different locations in three-dimensional space. Neither end is specifically an entrance or exit; all objects that travel through one portal will exit through the other. An important aspect of the game's physics is momentum redirection and conservation.[4] As moving objects pass through portals, they come through the exit portal at the same direction that the exit portal is facing and with the same speed with which they passed through the entrance portal.[5] For example, a common maneuver is to place a portal some distance below the player on the floor, jump down through it, gaining speed in freefall, and emerge through the other portal on a wall, flying over a gap or another obstacle. This process of gaining speed and then redirecting that speed towards another area of a puzzle allows the player to launch objects or Chell over great distances, both vertically and horizontally, referred to as 'flinging' by Valve.[4] As GLaDOS puts it, \"In layman's terms: speedy thing goes in, speedy thing comes out.\" If portal ends are not on parallel planes, the character passing through is reoriented to be upright with respect to gravity after leaving a portal end.\n","\n","Chell and all other objects in the game that can fit into the portal ends will pass through the portal. However, a portal shot cannot pass through an open portal; it will simply deactivate or create a new portal in an offset position. Creating a portal end instantly deactivates an existing portal end of the same color. Moving objects, glass, special wall surfaces, liquids, or areas that are too small will not be able to anchor portals. Chell is sometimes provided with cubes that she can pick up and use to climb on or to hold down large buttons that open doors or activate mechanisms. Particle fields, known as \"Emancipation Grills\", occasionally called \"Fizzlers\" in the developer commentary, exist at the end of all and within some test chambers; when passed through, they will deactivate any active portals and disintegrate any object carried through. These fields also block attempts to fire portals through them.[6]\n","\n","Although Chell is equipped with mechanized heel springs to prevent damage from falling,[4] she can be killed by various other hazards in the test chambers, such as turret guns, bouncing balls of energy, and toxic liquid. She can also be killed by objects hitting her at high speeds, and by a series of crushers that appear in certain levels. Unlike most action games at the time, there is no health indicator; Chell dies if she is dealt a certain amount of damage in a short period, but returns to full health fairly quickly. Some obstacles, such as the energy balls and crushing pistons, deal fatal damage with a single blow.\n","\n","Many solutions exist for completing each puzzle.[7] Two additional modes are unlocked upon the completion of the game that challenge the player to work out alternative methods of solving each test chamber. Challenge maps are unlocked near the halfway point and Advanced Chambers are unlocked when the game is completed.[8] In Challenge mode, levels are revisited with the added goal of completing the test chamber either with as little time, with the fewest portals, or with the fewest footsteps possible. In Advanced mode, certain levels are made more complex with the addition of more obstacles and hazards.[9][10]\n","\n","\n","Gameplay[edit]\n","\n","Portal Knights combines exploration and building elements with role-playing aspects.

A disembodied voice, possibly a psychologist, gives a report on the protagonist's mental state: He suggests that the stress of urban life may have been the root cause of his rampage, prompting him to \"go postal\". The lack of any mentions of military interference with the civilian population strongly implies that the Postal Dude's murders were the result of his own paranoid delusions. Amid distorted audio, the psychologist gives a final remark: \"We may never know exactly what set him off, but rest assured we will have plenty of time to study him\". Upon completion of the credits, manic cackling can be heard as the screen fades to black. It is suggested that the protagonist may have escaped the confines of the asylum to pursue further acts of violence.\n","\n","Due to the controversy surrounding the game's release, along with numerous, unrelated American school shootings in the years following, the 2016 redux of the game's ending has been changed.

These attributes start at one but can be increased by performing various activities, such as exercising or going to work. However, performing these activities will wear away at other attributes, including hunger, alertness, and happiness, and if these attributes are too low, some activities may not be available. These lesser attributes can be regained through eating, sleeping, and other events, though the main boxing attributes will slowly degrade with game time. The boxer will gain friends or other associates over the course of the game which will help also lead the character towards resolving the mystery of his father's murder, perform new activities to help raise the primary attributes, or aid in boosting the lesser attributes.

Fusion mode combines both Puyo and Tetris styles onto one board, with Tetrinimoes sinking below any Puyos when placed. Finally, Big Bang mode combines Fever mode from Puyo Puyo with Lucky Attack from Tetris. Depending on the style, players must quickly clear waves of pre-arranged Puyos or Tetris blocks, aiming to clear as many waves as possible within a time limit. After each time limit, players are dealt damage depending on how much slower they were against the leading player. Players are eliminated if they run out of health, and the last player (or side) standing wins the match. There is also an Adventure story more campaign consisting of various battles against computer opponents and mode-specific challenges, and six single-player Challenge modes: Endless Fever, Endless Puyo, and Tiny Puyo for the Puyo style; Sprint, Marathon, and Ultra for the Tetris style.[9] Playing through each mode earns credits that can be spent in an in-game shop to unlock different art styles for Puyos and Tetriminoes and alternate voice packs.\n","\n","\n","Gameplay[edit]\n","\n","Like the previous game, Puyo Puyo Tetris 2 revolves around the two different gameplay styles of the Puyo Puyo and Tetris series respectively. Players can choose between Puyo style, which involves arranging colored blobs (puyos) and matching them together to set off combo chains, and Tetris style, which involves placing shaped blocks (tetriminos) to create lines and removing them from the grid. Players compete against each other with the style of their choosing, with the aim of sending garbage to their opponents, causing their play field to overflow and eliminating them. The game features all the modes featured in the original Puyo Puyo Tetris, including the Swap and Fusion modes which feature both styles.\n","\n","In addition to a new story and characters, the game introduces new modes, such as Skill battles which allow for character based skills and items to quickly change the game. It was also stated to have an improved online mode from the first game, allowing for more competition in leagues and free play, as well as new modes.[4] In Adventure mode, the players traverse an overworld and engage in Skill Battles with other characters in the story, that acts more like a JRPG.[5]\n","\n","\n","Gameplay[edit]\n","\n","Puzzle & Dragons is a combination of two types of gameplay: tile matching and a monster collecting RPG. Players create teams by picking from the over 9000 different monsters they can acquire within the game and then play dungeons where they solve a tile-matching puzzle that determines how powerful their monsters' attacks are on waves of enemy monsters.\n","\n","\n","None\n","Gameplay[edit]\n","\n","The player's character, after waking up from some incident, finds himself with a pair of gloves that can interact with specific blocks that are in the walls, floors, and ceilings of the various rooms as he progresses. The function of the blocks are distinguished by colour: red blocks can be extended or retracted; yellow blocks, always in groups of three, can be used to make stair-like structures; blue blocks can be retracted to act like a springboard to whatever touches them; purple blocks provide means to rotate sections of walls of a room; and green blocks provide a sphere or cube, which the player will need to manipulate. In the early stages, the player's goal is to use a combination of these blocks to get themselves to an exit point, allowing them to move to the next chamber.[2]\n","\n","As the player progresses deeper into the unknown complex, new puzzle aspects are introduced. In one stage, the bulk of the chambers are dark except for specific coloured blocks, requiring the player to remember the location of other blocks as they manipulate them.[3] Another section features light-oriented puzzles, with the player using cubes and other features to orient the light beam in the correct fashion.[4]\n","\n","\n","Gameplay[edit]\n","\n","In Quake's single-player mode, players explore levels, facing monsters and finding secret areas before reaching an exit. Switches or keys open doors, and reaching the exit takes the player to the next level. Before accessing an episode, there is a set of three pathways with easy, medium, and hard skill levels. The fourth skill level, \"Nightmare\", was \"so bad that it was hidden, so people won't wander in by accident\";[12] the player must drop through water before the episode four entrance and go into a secret passage to access it.\n","\n","Quake's single-player campaign is organized into four individual episodes with seven to eight levels in each (including one secret level per episode, one of which is a \"low gravity\" level that challenges the player's abilities in a different way). If the player's character dies, they must restart at the beginning of that level. The game may be saved at any time in the PC versions and between levels in the console versions. Upon completing an episode, the player is returned to the hub \"START\" level, where another episode can be chosen. Each episode starts the player from scratch, without any previously collected items. Episode one (which formed the shareware or downloadable demo version of Quake) has the most traditional ideology of a boss in the last level. The ultimate objective at the end of each episode is to recover a magic rune. After all of the runes are collected, the floor of the hub level opens up to reveal an entrance to the \"END\" level which contains a final puzzle.\n","\n","Plot[edit]\n","\n","In the single-player game, the player takes the role of the unnamed protagonist, named Ranger in later games (voiced by Trent Reznor),[15] sent into a portal in order to stop an enemy code-named \"Quake\". The government had been experimenting with teleportation technology and developed a working prototype called a \"Slipgate\"; the mysterious Quake compromised the Slipgate by connecting it with its own teleportation system, using it to send death squads to the \"Human\" dimension in order to test the martial capabilities of humanity.\n","\n","The sole surviving protagonist in \"Operation Counterstrike\" is Ranger, who must advance, starting each of the four episodes from an overrun human military base, before fighting his way into other dimensions, reaching them via the Slipgate or their otherworld equivalent. After passing through the Slipgate, Ranger's main objective is to collect four magic runes from four dimensions of Quake; these are the key to stopping the enemy and ending the invasion of Earth.\n","\n","The single-player campaign consists of 30 separate levels, or \"maps\", divided into four episodes (with a total of 26 regular maps and four secret ones), as well as a hub level to select a difficulty setting and episode, and the game's final boss level. Each episode represents individual dimensions that the player can access through magical portals (as opposed to the technological Slipgate) that are discovered over the course of the game. The various realms consist of a number of gothic, medieval, and lava-filled caves and dungeons, with a recurring theme of hellish and satanic imagery reminiscent of Doom (such as pentagrams and images of demons on the walls). The game's setting is inspired by dark fantasy influences, including H. P. Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos.[16] Dimensional Shamblers appear as enemies, the \"Spawn\" enemies are called \"Formless Spawn of Tsathoggua\" in the manual, the boss of the first episode is named Chthon, the main villain is named Shub-Niggurath and is explicitly stated to be an Old One, and the four episodes all have Lovecraftian names.[16]\n","\n","\n","Gameplay[edit]\n","\n","Quarantine Circular is a conversation-based adventure game, presented in a three-dimensional, third-person perspective. The player controls a variety of characters who make decisions to resolve the situation.  Options are limited depending on the character, reflecting their preconceptions.\n","\n","\n","Gameplay[edit]\n","\n","The player can assume the role of one of four different character class types, the Warrior, Wizard, Assassin or Shaman. The player enters a Mansion on the top floor and gradually progress down the increasing difficulty floors by leveling up.\n","The entire game is randomly generated, so monsters, traps, loot are never on the same place. The game world is placed in a tile-based square grid that is viewed from a top-down perspective, where the player, enemies, items and objects occupy discrete squares. The game is turn-based, and both the player and numerous enemies take turns performing actions. The game has a very fast approach to the turn-based mechanic, and while the player does have to wait for the enemies to take turn, everything is done very quickly to keep the action fluid. Each turn the player may move or attack monsters in adjacent squares, pick, drop, and use items, and interact with various in-game objects. Permanent death is a major part of the game, in which if the player dies by losing all HP it will restart from the beginning of the game, thus creating a different dungeon, there are no options inside the game to change this, so while the player can save and continue later at any moment, if he dies he can't continue.\n","\n","Plot[edit]\n","\n","The game doesn't take itself very seriously and makes fun of the traditional plots. In this case, an Evil Dark Lord steals all the light in the world and traps it inside a magical lantern. The four heroes decide that it would be a good idea if one of them enters alone. This is a nod to B movie plots where sometimes characters make the most illogical decision.\n","\n","\n","None\n","None\n","None\n","Gameplay[edit]\n","\n","Rad is a roguelike video game played from an isometric perspective.[1] In the game, players control a teenager whose goal is to explore a procedurally-generated wasteland for effigies known as respirators, items that may restore the human civilizations after a devastating apocalypse.

Before he can leave, Yasumizu is enshrouded by mist, and everyone in town must begin the Feast of the Yomi-Purge, an event in which several villagers become \"wolves\" and must kill one person each night. During the day, the villagers share information and vote to hang someone to eliminate the wolves. According to legend, the wolves are yomibito risen from the dead, and must be purged.\n","\n","As the Feast continues, Haruaki discovers his ability to loop back in time after death, returning to the day he entered the village and repeating his actions. Unable to escape the loop, Haruaki relies on his memories, in the hopes of learning the truth about the Feast's origin, Yasumizu's secrets, and the truth behind the looping.\n","\n","In one route, Haruaki bonds with Chiemi and learns her fear of God and the supernatural corruption plaguing Yasumizu. The wolves win the Feast and reveal that the mountain god Shin'nai told them the humans are the true yomibito who need to be saved. Haruaki and Chiemi attempt to run away, but they are unable to escape and Chiemi rots away into the mist.\n","\n","In another route, Haruaki gains the role of the \"snake,\" allowing him to learn whether someone is a wolf or human each night. His deductions lead the humans to victory over the wolves. During the Feast, he grows close to Rikako Uematsu, a mysterious priestess with the power to heal others by taking in their corruption. Haruaki plans to start a new life with her after the Feast ends, but the remaining villagers are suddenly massacred and Haruaki loops back once again.\n","\n","In the third route, Haruaki becomes a wolf and learns the inner workings of the Feast. He gets to know his fellow wolf Haru Makishima, a girl who lost her parents in a previous Feast eight years prior. Haru is possessed by a god named Mujina, who is aware of Haruaki's looping ability. By questioning her, Haruaki learns more about Yasumizu's gods. Haruaki ultimately wins the Feast, and a monstrous being appears in the sky. Haruaki is greeted by a sheep who explains to him that he is within someone else's dream, and the dreamer is resetting time to awaken the being. The sheep tells him it has been allowing Haruaki to keep his memories, and sends him back in time to prevent the country's destruction.\n","\n","Haruaki reconvenes with Chiemi and realizes that she also remembers each time loop. Together, they make numerous attempts to escape the mists and change the events of the Feast, but they remain trapped. Haruaki returns to a number of key points in previous Feasts to speak with other villagers, and begins to understand the truth: the Feast is a man-made game devised by the Miguruma clan, a powerful family in the neighboring village of Fujiyoshi. The Migurumas would ostracize certain people and send them to live in Yasumizu, and fabricated their legends and culture to keep the villagers dedicated to purging yomibito.\n","\n","Haruaki visits the sheep once more, and asks to be sent back as far as possible. Armed with his knowledge, he returns to Yasumizu and poses as a god, asking the villagers to stop the Feast, and restoring their faith in Mujina.

The player can build a large network of railway lines and buy various locomotives to serve cities and industries - growing cities in the process, and hire railway personnel for both train operations and office positions, all with individual bonuses and personality types. The player can also unlock innovations such as new locomotives or bonuses to revenue. The game has five main game modes: campaign mode, scenario mode, free mode, sandbox mode and challenge mode.[6][7][8]\n","\n","The Campaign mode mainly takes the player through the building of the First transcontinental railroad, the exception being mission four which is based around the American Civil War. In this mode, the player must fulfil tasks as well as competing with AI controlled competitors. In the Scenario mode, these competitors are selectable and playable characters with specific gameplay bonuses. The tasks are also considerably harder in scenario mode. In Free mode, the task list is randomly generated upon start-up, and the tasks given are not compulsory. Players can also choose how many competitors they have (between 0 and 3). Sandbox mode has no tasks and all locomotives are automatically researched. There are also no competitors and money is infinite. Challenge mode is similar to scenarios and free mode but players compete with other players on an online leaderboard.[7][9]\n","\n","\n","Gameplay[edit]\n","\n","The player's character, referred to as a \"slugcat\", uses spears and rocks to survive in a hostile, ruined, and obtuse 2D world.[3][4] The player is given little explicit guidance and is free to explore the world in any direction[4] via pipes and passages that pass through over 1600 static screens, each with enemies that spawn in set locations and can then move from screen to screen.[5][6] The slugcat can jump, swim, and climb poles to avoid enemies while foraging for sparse food, which is used to hibernate in scarce, designated safe rooms. Hibernation resets the day cycle and saves the player's progress. If the player does not reach the hibernation point before the end of the day cycle, a crushing rain will pour, flooding the world and ensuring the slugcat dies through drowning or being pummeled by the rains. However, if the slugcat has not eaten sufficient food, it will not be allowed to hibernate normally. Instead it will wake up in starvation mode, where it becomes sluggish and faints often. Unless it eats enough food to fill up the hunger bar, it will not return to normal and will starve to death once the cycle ends through hibernation.[4]\n","\n","Upon death, the slugcat returns to the last hibernation save point. The player also loses a karma point, which are indicated at the bottom of the screen. Karma is gained upon successfully hibernating, and the player can shield their current karma level by eating a yellow flower. The flower appears at the start of each area and is re-planted wherever the slugcat dies. The player needs to meet a karmic threshold to reach specific areas of the game.[3]\n","\n","Enemies range from camouflaged plants to large vultures to Komodo dragon-like lizards and large aquatic creatures. Many enemies can kill the slugcat in one hit, and some species have different variations, such as the many types of lizards, all with unique abilities. The enemies spawn from set dens and can then move freely throughout rooms, meaning the player is faced with problems that they sometimes cannot avoid.[4] Enemies possess dynamic AI and exist in the game's world perpetually, even when not on the same screen as the player.[7] Players are expected to mainly evade the enemies[8], but they do need to experiment with spears to climb walls and knock fruit off of vines.[3] It is possible to kill enemies through the use of prolonged attacks, though attacking them is mainly used as a way to ward them off. However, this becomes more of a requirement in the base game's hardest campaign, Hunter, where the slugcat is a carnivore and must eat the flesh of other creatures to hibernate.[9] The slugcat, if holding an object in each hand, can swap their places by pressing the grab button twice.[5] It can also eat power-up plants, which grant status effects,[4] such as slowing time.[3]\n","\n","Rain World's setting is destroyed by ecological catastrophe and illustrated in pixel art. Its story is communicated through details in the environment, images during hibernation, and holograms from a worm-like creature that monitors the slugcat, more commonly known as an overseer.[4] The game offers little to guide the player, apart from the overseer, who gives some hints about where to go and what to collect towards the beginning of the game. The player can view a map to check their progress through the large in-game world.[10]\n","\n","The player can choose between two campaigns at the outset: Monk and Survivor. As Monk, creatures are less inclined to be aggressive and food is more plentiful. Beating either Monk or Survivor unlocks a third character, Hunter, with a difficult campaign featuring more powerful and hostile creatures. Monk and Hunter were added in the 1.5 update, and Monk was created to address concerns about the game's difficulty. The 1.5 update also added a local multiplayer arena mode, and a sandbox mode where players can spawn in objects and creatures from the game.[9][11]\n","\n","The Downpour expansion adds five new campaigns, which are set during different points in the timeline, and enables local multiplayer for story modes. Each campaign features a new slugcat with new abilities. Spearmaster can create spears but must eat by attacking creatures, Rivulet is faster but has shorter day cycles, Gourmand has access to a crafting system, Artificer can double jump and create explosives, and Saint has a grappling tongue but is unable to throw spears.[12] Downpour also adds three new game modes: Safari mode lets players freely observe the world or control any living creature within it, Challenge mode provides 70 scored challenges, and Expedition is a semi-roguelike mode with random missions that award perks upon completion. Downpour's release was accompanied by the free Rain World Remix upgrade, which added accessibility options and ways to customize game difficulty.[13]\n","\n","Plot[edit]\n","\n","The Monk and Survivor campaigns share a similar plot. When a group of slugcats crosses a river in the rain, the Survivor slips off a pipe and falls, becoming separated from the others. The Monk is the Survivor's sibling. Regardless of which character is chosen, the slugcat wakes up alone to explore the abandoned world.\n","\n","Eventually it reaches Five Pebbles, a massive decaying supercomputer, and meets the AI's robotic avatar. Five Pebbles explains that like all creatures, the slugcat is trapped in a stagnant cycle of death and rebirth and wants it to end. He then directs it to a place where it can free itself from the \"great cycle\". Following his guidance, the slugcat travels to an underground chasm and enters a sea of \"Void Fluid\", which helps it ascend.\n","\n","More information about the setting can be obtained by bringing pearls to a damaged robot named Looks to the Moon. She explains that the ancient civilization that once inhabited the world sought to escape the eternal cycle and succeeded, collectively ascending from existence. She and Five Pebbles are \"iterators\", AIs created by the ancients to calculate a way for every living organism to ascend. Iterators use vast quantities of water, causing the rain.\n","\n","The iterators decay over time, but since the cycle of rebirth exists, they will live forever and the ancients expected them to eventually find a solution. Five Pebbles rejected this purpose and tried to overwrite a self-destruction taboo with excess intake of water, damaging Looks to the Moon to the point of nonfunctionality.\n","\n","The Hunter campaign chronologically takes place before the Survivor and Monk campaigns. As Hunter, the player starts with a pearl and a green artifact containing \"slag reset keys\". The Hunter delivers the slag reset keys to Looks to the Moon, partially revitalizing her after the damage caused by Five Pebbles. If the Hunter gives Moon the pearl as well, its message reveals that a third iterator, No Significant Harassment, sent the Hunter to help her.[14][15]\n","\n","\n","None\n","Gameplay[edit]\n","\n","The gameplay incorporates elements of stealth and detective work. It includes some cross-genre gameplay standards such as lockpicking doors and gathering key items.

One of its main gameplay elements is puzzle solving.[1]\n","\n","\n","Gameplay[edit]\n","\n","The game carries on the style of gameplay from Rayman Origins in which up to four players (depending on the format) simultaneously make their way through various levels. Lums can be collected by touching them, defeating enemies, or freeing captured Teensies. Collecting Teensies unlocks new worlds, which can be played in any order once they are available. Along with Rayman, Globox, and the Teensies returning as playable characters, players can now control the new female character Barbara the Barbarian Princess, her sister and their cousins, once they are rescued from certain stages.[6]\n","\n","In addition to the main playable characters, Murfy the greenbottle, who first appeared in Rayman 2: The Great Escape, appears as an assist character. Murfy can perform various actions such as cutting through ropes, activating mechanisms, grabbing hold of enemies and assisting in gathering Lums. These offer a range of levels in which co-operation is required to progress.[7] In the Wii U, PlayStation Vita, and PlayStation 4 versions of the game, an additional player can control Murfy directly with touch controls, using the Wii U GamePad, the Vita's front touch screen, and the Dual Shock 4 touchpad respectively.[8] In single-player mode, control will switch over to Murfy during certain sections whilst the computer controls the player's character.[9] In the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Xbox One, and PC versions of the game, Murfy moves automatically and can be prompted to interact with certain objects with button controls.[10] Other new features include sections where players can fire projectile fists at enemies and rhythm based levels set to covers of songs such as \"Black Betty\", \"Eye of the Tiger\", and \"Woo-Hoo\".\n","\n","The game features over one hundred twenty levels, including forty remastered levels from the original Rayman Origins, which are unlocked by obtaining Lucky Tickets, which can also win additional Lums and Teensies.[11] Some levels feature remixed 'Invaded' versions, which must be completed as quickly as possible. The game also offers daily and weekly challenge stages, in which players can compete with other players via leaderboards in challenges such as collecting a certain number of Lums in a short time or surviving the longest on a stage. More challenge stages can be accessed by raising the player's 'awesomeness' rating, which increases by collecting trophies earned by rescuing Teensies, collecting a high number of Lums in each level or by having a high leaderboard position at the end of a challenge. A local multiplayer football game, Kung Foot, is also featured, in which players use attacks to knock a football into the opponent's goal.\n","\n","Plot[edit]\n","\n","Its plot takes place one century after the events of Rayman Origins. Rayman, Globox, and the Teensies have been asleep ever since. During that time, the Bubble Dreamer's nightmares grew in strength and numbers, and so has the Magician (who has survived the explosion in Rayman Origins), who has split into five \"Dark Teensies\". Rayman and friends are awakened by their friend Murfy who tells them about the bad news and tells them that the ten princesses of the land (including Barbara) and the Teensies have been captured by the nightmares and the Dark Teensies. Rayman, Globox, the Teensies, and Murfy set out to defeat these new threats. After defeating four of the Dark Teensies and fighting the worst of the nightmares, including a mechanical dragon built and controlled by the fourth Dark Teensie in his underwater base, Rayman and friends go to Olympus Maximus and confront a giant cloud composed of little ferocious dark creatures of dark energy known as Hades’ Hand. After the creature has been destroyed and the last Dark Teensie is sent to the moon, the credits roll. If four hundred teensies are saved, the player unlocks the last world of the game, Living Dead Party. Once completed, the nightmares are defeated and the player is awarded ten thousand lums and six new invasion paintings. Once the player saves all seven hundred (or eight hundred and twenty-six in the Nintendo Switch version) Teensies, they unlock the Golden Teensie.\n","\n","\n","Gameplay[edit]\n","\n","RBI Baseball was the first console game of its kind to be licensed by the Major League Baseball Players Association (MLBPA) and used actual MLB player names, unlike other baseball video games of the late 1980s. As it was not licensed by Major League Baseball (MLB) itself, it did not use team nicknames or logos. Instead, the game contained 8 teams listed by only their location: Boston, California, Detroit, Houston, Minnesota, New York, St. Louis, and San Francisco; their real-life, MLB counterparts were the first place teams in each division in 1986 (Boston, California, Houston, New York) and 1987 (Detroit, Minnesota, St. Louis, San Francisco) MLB seasons.  The game also boasted two All-Star teams, American League and National League; the two featured established veterans such as George Brett, Mike Schmidt, Dale Murphy and Andre Dawson—none of whom appeared on the other eight teams—and up-and-coming players like Mark McGwire, Andrés Galarraga, Kevin Seitzer and José Canseco.\n","\n","Each player has different capabilities in the game; hitters vary in ability to make solid contact, to hit the ball with power, and their base running speed. Vince Coleman is the fastest player in the game; it is very difficult to catch him stealing second base. Pitchers vary in pitching speed, and the amount by which the player can steer the ball left and right during its flight. Pitchers also have varying stamina; as a pitcher gets tired, the ball slows down and is harder to steer. Nolan Ryan and Roger Clemens are two pitchers in the game with the fastest pitches.  Fernando Valenzuela, without a hard fastball, has tremendous movement in both directions with his pitches.  Mike Scott has a sharp and deceptive breaking ball.  The best pitcher is debatable, depending on how they are used by the players.  There is no evidence that fielding abilities correspond to individual players.\n","\n","The abilities of each player do not necessarily correspond with the statistics shown on the screen when the player comes to bat or takes the mound. These statistics are generally accurate, with many exceptions (see below). They do not change during the course of the game or sequence of games.\n","\n","A rudimentary box score is displayed during and after the game showing composite statistics for each team. A hit batter is credited with a walk, and anyone reaching on an error gets credited for a hit even as the other team is charged with an error. Conversely, a batter thrown out while trying for extra bases is not credited with a hit.\n","\n","The infield fly rule is not implemented.\n","\n","The rosters for the eight teams are fairly accurate if simplified representations of the playoff rosters from their respective years. Each team has 8 starting batters, four bench players, two starting pitchers and two relievers. The player can start any pitcher they like, though the relievers have very low stamina. But if they play consecutive games without resetting the system, any starting pitcher used in the previous game will be unavailable. The player has to wait until the game starts before substituting players with pinch hitters, who can play any position. Pinch runners are not implemented.\n","\n","Unlike Major League Baseball, R.B.I. Baseball implements the mercy rule—if one team is ahead by ten or more runs after any number of completed innings, the game ends immediately.\n","\n","Additionally, while the statistics shown on the screen for each player in the original game were reasonably accurate, their playing attributes were not always accurate. For example, George Brett was depicted in-game as a right-handed batter, while the real-life Brett batted left-handed. Also, all real-life switch hitters, such as Tim Raines, were depicted exclusively as left-handed batters.[8]\n","\n","In Vs. RBI Baseball, the teams are made up of legends from 10 different franchises. These players were statistically represented with their best seasons. A notable exception was that of McGwire, who was included on the Oakland team, and was statistically represented by his potential numbers. In a remarkable display of foresight, he was projected to hit 62 home runs in his best season. In 1998, he set the then-major league record for home runs in a season with 70.\n","\n","From the second game onward in the original R.B.I. Baseball series, all of the (then) 26 (later 28) Major League Baseball teams were featured; however, these later games also did not have a full MLB license, so the teams were only identified by their cities (however, they still had real player names as they had the MLBPA license).

Ten years before the events of Rebel Galaxy, Juno retired from the DoubleJacks after marrying her husband, Brace, and settled into the quiet life of a law-abiding citizen in the backwater Dodge Sector. When she receives word from Brace's friend Connor McCarthy that Brace was murdered on a trading run by a man named Ruthless, Juno hunts him down in the Texas system, but bungles her attempt to kill him and is shot down. Broke and without a ship, Juno asks for a favor from her old contact Orzu, who lets her have an obsolete garbage scow to get back on her feet in return for delivering a stolen weapons system to him. Orzu then directs Juno to the android mercenary Satchel, who knows how to find Ruthless.\n","\n","While waiting for Satchel to find a lead, Juno is roped into rejoining the DoubleJacks by her friend Marla in order to break Ansel, the gang's original leader, out of prison and get rid of his disliked successor. After this interlude, Satchel returns with word of Ruthless's location. When Juno finally confronts Ruthless, he is adamant that he had nothing to do with Brace's death and suggests Connor was playing an angle. The two cooperate to locate Connor and force him to divulge the truth: Brace is still alive, and he bribed Connor to lie about his death. Brace eventually contacts Juno himself and reveals that he carried out the scheme at the behest of Juno's mother, Tatiana Markev.\n","\n","Meanwhile, Juno has also been coerced into helping CEO Xander Brust of Brust Arms, the company that she stole Orzu's weapons system from, investigate the disappearance of several shipping convoys. A battlecruiser equipped with a superweapon is found to be the culprit, and Juno later captures a pilot who connects the superweapon to Tatiana. When Juno and Tatiana reunite, the latter explains that she has been assembling a burgeoning criminal empire as a gift to Juno; Tatiana had hoped Brace's false death would shake Juno out of her complacency and prepare her to run the empire. Juno angrily rejects her mother's plans, but is soon arrested by the Dodge Sector Police for her part in Ansel's escape. To regain her freedom, Juno must choose between helping the police capture Tatiana, or warning Tatiana and helping her pirate armada, the Red Devils, wipe out the police fleet.

When an item is collected, it is stored in an inventory that the player can access at any time. Items in the inventory can be used, examined, and combined to solve puzzles and gain access to areas that were previously inaccessible.[2] The inventory is limited to a certain number of slots, and the player must often move items from the inventory to storage boxes located in certain areas to manage space.[2]\n","\n","Although the player can use firearms to kill monsters, Resident Evil emphasizes evasion over fast-paced combat by providing the player with limited ammunition. The player has a limited amount of health, which decreases when attacked by monsters. Players can regain health by collecting and using herbs, which can be mixed with other herbs to increase their healing effect.[2] Some monsters can also infect the player with a poisoning effect, which gradually depletes the player's health over time until the poison is cured with serum or special herbs.[2] Zombies that are defeated but not beheaded or burned eventually revive and mutate into faster and deadlier forms.[3]\n","\n","The player can control either Chris Redfield or Jill Valentine, each with advantages and disadvantages.[4] For example, Chris can take and deal more damage than Jill, but Jill can carry more items and unlock certain doors with a lock pick. Both characters can equip defensive weapons that can save them from taking damage when seized by an enemy. These defensive weapons include a dagger and a unique special weapon: Jill can use a taser, while Chris can shove stun grenades into zombies' mouths and detonate them with a pistol shot.[5] Defensive weapons are limited and can only be used when the player is grabbed by a monster.[5]\n","\n","The game features an automap to help players navigate the different areas of the game. Additionally, the player can pick up maps of certain sections to reveal unexplored areas.[2] To save their progress, players need to find ink ribbons and use them with a typewriter; the game features a limited supply of ink ribbons, so players cannot save their progress as many times as they want.[2] The story is slightly altered by the character the player chooses to play as,[4] and certain choices the player makes in the game can impact the direction of the game and its ending.[6] Upon completing the game under a certain difficulty setting and time limit, the player may unlock secret costumes for the main characters, bonus weapons, and special difficulty modes.[7]\n","\n","Plot[edit]\n","\n","On July 24, 1998, a series of bizarre murders occur on the outskirts of the Midwestern town of Raccoon City.

Bravo Team survivor Rebecca Chambers joins Chris. The player character learns that a series of illegal experiments were undertaken by a clandestine research team under the authority of a biomedical company Umbrella Corporation. The creatures roaming the mansion and its surrounding areas are the results of these experiments, which have exposed the mansion's personnel and animals to a highly contagious and mutagenic biological agent known as the T-virus.\n","\n","The player character discovers a secret underground laboratory containing Umbrella's experiments. There, they find Jill or Chris in a cell and encounter Wesker programming a Tyrant, a humanoid bioweapon.

In the ensuing confrontation, Wesker is apparently killed and the player character defeats the Tyrant. After activating the lab's self-destruct system, the player character reaches the heliport and contacts Brad for extraction.

If they travel together, either one of them can be controlled while the other character is handled by the game's artificial intelligence (AI). The player may also control both simultaneously or split them up to explore areas separately.[3] Each character has unique abilities. Rebecca has a mixing kit which allows her to combine herbs and other chemicals, but she is weak defensively.

As she explores the train, she teams up with Billy Coen—a former Marine Force Reconnaissance officer, who was to be executed for killing 23 people until the military police van transporting him crashed in the region.\n","\n","The pair notices the mysterious young man, moments before the train suddenly begins moving again. Unbeknownst to the pair, two soldiers from Umbrella, on the orders of Albert Wesker and William Birkin, attempt to take control of the train and destroy it, but are killed by leeches before they can complete their mission. As the train speeds out of control, Rebecca and Billy apply the brakes and avert its course towards an abandoned training facility for future executives of Umbrella. They discover that the former director of the facility and the corporation's co-founder, Dr. James Marcus, was responsible for discovering the so-called Progenitor virus in the 1960s, and decided to examine its potential as a biological weapon. He combined it with leech DNA to develop the T-virus that causes rapid mutations in living organisms and thus transforms humans and animals into zombies and monsters.\n","\n","As the pair continue to explore the facility, Wesker decides to leave Umbrella and join its rival company, and makes plans for further research on the T-virus. William Birkin refuses his offer to join him, instead opting to complete his research on the G-virus. Later, Rebecca becomes separated from Billy. On her own, she encounters Captain Enrico Marini, who tells her that the rest of the Bravo team will meet up at an old mansion they found, but allows her to stay behind to find Billy. Just after Enrico leaves, Rebecca is attacked by the Tyrant. After temporarily defeating the Tyrant, Rebecca meets up with Billy again and, together, they defeat it and continue on towards a water plant.\n","\n","Eventually, Rebecca and Billy catch up with the leech-controlling man, who happens to be Marcus' final experiment, Queen Leech. In 1988, Marcus was assassinated on the orders of Umbrella's other co-founder, Oswell E. Spencer, who sought his research. After his corpse was dumped, Queen Leech entered his body and reanimated it, gaining his memories and the ability to shapeshift, thus believing itself to be the resurrected Marcus and orchestrated the T-virus outbreak in the facility and on the train as a means of revenge against Umbrella. After temporarily defeating it, Billy and Rebecca attempt to escape to the surface via a lift, just as William Birkin trips the facility's self-destruct mechanism. Pursued by Queen Leech, the pair eventually kill it and escape before the facility is destroyed. Following their escape, Rebecca notices the mansion that Marini mentioned and prepares to head for it. Before she does, she assures Billy that her police report will list him as another casualty of the incident. Thanking her for his freedom, Billy departs as Rebecca heads towards the mansion to seek out the whereabouts of her fellow Bravo Team members (seen in Resident Evil).\n","\n","\n","Gameplay[edit]\n","\n","Resident Evil 2 is a remake of the 1998 game Resident Evil 2 for PlayStation. Unlike the original, which uses tank controls and fixed camera angles, the remake features \"over-the-shoulder\" third-person shooter gameplay similar to Resident Evil 4 and more recent games in the series that allows players the option to move while using their weapons similar to Resident Evil 6.[1]\n","\n","The assisted and standard difficulty modes deviate from the original by featuring autosaves and allowing players to save as often as they would like inside safe rooms. If the player chooses to play on \"Hardcore\" difficulty, players will be required to collect and use a finite number of ink ribbons to save the game's progress, much like in the original game.[2]\n","\n","While exploring the police station, players can find and pick up items that can help them survive and escape. Certain items such as herbs and gun powder can be combined to make healing items and ammunition respectively. Items can also be inspected for clues gaining access to certain areas or items hidden throughout the game and can be discarded after use.[3][4]\n","\n","Overall combat varies depending on difficulty. Assisted difficulty allows aim assist and health recovery along with weaker enemies while hardcore difficulty has stronger enemies and has scarce ammo for players to find. Combat will also vary depending on who players are fighting. Enemies will generally come after players after they are spotted and can be killed or crippled to slow them down. Zombies will attempt to break into the station through windows but can be stopped if the windows are boarded up beforehand. Certain enemies must be fought to progress through the game and cannot be avoided.\n","\n","Although Leon and Claire will both start with handguns at the beginning of their scenarios, each has different weapons that can be obtained throughout the game. Weapons can also be customized by finding and equipping gun parts that will improve their performance. Sub weapons like knives and grenades can also be found and equipped and used to attack and fend off enemies that grab onto the player. When standing still, weapon accuracy increases and the crosshair tightens, rewarding the player for playing in a style similar to earlier entries. \n","\n","At certain points in each scenario, players will encounter the Tyrant, a  Bio-Organic Weapon (B.O.W.) sent by Umbrella to eliminate all survivors in the police station and will attempt to kill the player when encountered. The Tyrant cannot be killed, although weapons can stun or slow him down. While players can evade the Tyrant, he will constantly search throughout the station except for safe rooms and certain areas of the police station.\n","\n","As with the 1998 game, the remake of Resident Evil 2 offers the option to play through the main campaign as either Leon S. Kennedy, a rookie police officer on his first day, or Claire Redfield, a college student and sister of original protagonist Chris. Depending on the player's choice, the main story will be experienced with variations in subplots, accessible areas, obtainable items, weapons, and the final boss battle. Also like the original, both campaigns feature a supporting character who becomes playable for one section of the game. Players control the mysterious Ada Wong in Leon's story, whose segment involves hacking electronic devices, and young girl Sherry Birkin in Claire's story, whose segment centers around stealth.\n","\n","Similar to the \"Scenario B\" feature of the original game, beating the main campaign for the first time unlocks the option to play through a \"2nd Run\" as the other protagonist. 2nd Run is a variation of the main campaign that adds additional content to frame the second playthrough as occurring concurrently with the first playthrough. For example, the protagonist in 2nd Run will enter the police station from a different entrance and find several doors already unlocked by the protagonist from the first playthrough. Completing 2nd Run is also required to experience the true ending of the main campaign. Selecting the \"New Game\" scenario for the selected character allows players to start with the default item loadout with items they had playing the game for the first time.\n","\n","The remake brings back \"The 4th Survivor\" and \"The Tofu Survivor\" minigames present in the 1998 original, which are unlocked after completing the 2nd Run mode. \"The 4th Survivor\" follows Umbrella Corporation operative Hunk and requires players to travel from the sewers to the outside of the police department while facing a large number of enemies. \"The Tofu Survivor\" features the same scenario, but replaces Hunk with an anthropomorphic tofu armed only with knives. The remake's version of \"The Tofu Survivor\" also adds the unlockable characters Konjac, Uirō-Mochi, Flan, and Annin Tofu, who all have a unique item loadout.\n","\n","Plot[edit]\n","\n","On the night of September 28, 1998[5] two months after the events of Resident Evil, rookie police officer Leon S. Kennedy makes his way toward Raccoon City to start his first shift at the police department.  At a gas station on the city outskirts, he meets Claire Redfield who is looking for her missing brother.  The gas station is overrun by zombies, as well as the rest of Raccoon City after a strain of the T-virus was carried into the city water supply.[6]  The two reach the Raccoon City Police Department but are separated when a truck driver crashes his vehicle. Depending on the player character, either Leon or Claire finds that the police department is also overrun with zombies after being briefly rescued by Marvin Branagh.  Marvin hands the player character a notebook from another deceased officer, which holds information about a secret passage out of the police department.  Branagh, infected, later turns into a zombie. The player character eventually finds the underground passage but is attacked by mutated Umbrella Corporation leading scientist William Birkin but defeats him.\n","\n","Inside the parking garage, Leon is attacked by zombie dogs but is saved by Ada Wong.  Ada claims to be an FBI agent sent to retrieve the \"G-virus\", the virus responsible for mutating Birkin which he developed with his wife and coworker Annette.  She hopes to retrieve a sample of the G-virus to incriminate Umbrella.[7] Claire finds paperwork confirming her brother had left Raccoon City weeks prior to investigate Umbrella elsewhere, and eventually she runs into Sherry— a young girl and the daughter of William.[8]\n","\n","Leon discovers reporter Ben Bertolucci in the holding cells, imprisoned by corrupt Police Chief and serial killer Brian Irons for investigating Umbrella.  As Ben tries to convince Leon to release him, he is killed by the Tyrant— a monster created by the T-virus.  Leon attempts to leave the police station, but is attacked by the Tyrant and saved again by Ada.  They discover gun salesman Robert Kendo and his infected daughter Emma inside his gun shop across the street, and Leon pledges to help Ada retrieve the G-virus sample to prove Umbrella's corruption.  Leon and Ada meet Annette in the sewers before she forces them to pursue her to the underground Umbrella lab NEST, unwilling to give up the G-virus sample.[9]  The two kiss as they descend to NEST.\n","\n","Sherry is kidnapped by Chief Irons, who has been covering up Umbrella's activities,[10]  but William arrives and injects Irons with a \"G-embryo\".  Claire reaches the orphanage where Irons is keeping Sherry, but the embryo births from Irons's stomach and kills him.  Claire is knocked unconscious by William as they flee into the sewers and she is separated from Sherry. William infects Sherry— certain her body will not reject the G-virus and will allow it to replicate.[11]\n","\n","Finding Sherry and descending further underground into NEST, Claire finds the G-virus vaccine and Annette administers it to her daughter.  Leon finds the G-virus sample but runs into Annette again.  Annette outs Ada as a mercenary selling the sample to the highest bidder before she is mortally wounded by William. Ada demands the sample from Leon at gunpoint, but is knocked off into the abyss below the facility along with the sample and Leon is unable to save her.[12]  Annette dies and as the NEST facility is set to self-destruct, Leon is attacked by the Tyrant, now a mutated and deadlier \"Super Tyrant\".  Ada, seemingly surviving her fall, tosses Leon an RPG and he kills the Tyrant.  Claire staves off a further mutated William before the trio reunites on a train out of the facility.  William attacks the train once more in a final mutated form, but the train is decoupled and William is destroyed in the lab's destruction.  The next morning Leon, Claire, and Sherry emerge far outside the confines of Raccoon City and into safety.  Leon and Claire vow to continue their fight against the Umbrella Corporation.[13]\n","\n","\n","Gameplay[edit]\n","\n","Resident Evil 3 is a survival horror third-person shooter game.[1] Although the player controls Resident Evil protagonist Jill Valentine through most of the game, certain sections require the player to control a supporting character, Carlos Oliveira, for short periods.[2] The player must explore the environment to open doors, climb up ladders, and pick up items. When an item is collected, it is stored in an inventory that can be accessed at any time. Items in the inventory can be used, examined, and combined to solve puzzles and gain access to areas that were previously inaccessible.[3] The player may also pick up maps to reveal unexplored sections in the game's automap, which shows the player's current position and indicates if an area still has items to collect.[4] Cutscenes with occasional quick time events are featured at regular intervals to advance the story.[5]\n","\n","As the player progresses throughout the game, a variety of computer-controlled monsters will try to hinder the player's progress.[2] The player can acquire and use multiple weapons, including combat knives, firearms, and grenades.[6] Some weapons can be customized with additional parts to improve their performance.[7] A creature called Nemesis is the game's primary antagonist and pursues the player in key moments.[8] He gradually mutates into more aggressive forms as the player defeats him during several encounters.[9] The player has a certain amount of health which decreases when Jill or Carlos take damage.[10] On higher difficulty settings, ammunition and health recovery items are scarce, and getting past opponents without killing them is generally encouraged.[11] Jill has the ability to dodge incoming attacks at close range, while Carlos can perform melee attacks to stagger opponents.[12] If Jill or Carlos die, the player must start the game again from the last save point.[8]\n","\n","Once the player completes the game on the highest difficulty setting, two additional difficulty modes can be unlocked. These disable autosaves, make opponents tougher to defeat, change certain encounters, and rearrange item locations.[13] Additionally, upon completing the game for the first time, an item shop is unlocked in the game's main menu, allowing the player to spend points on in-game advantages such as items that boost the player's healing and damage, as well as entirely new weapons. Points are earned by completing a number of challenges, ranging from finding all weapon upgrades to destroying hidden bobbleheads known as Charlie dolls.[14] Unlocking items is essential to completing the game's most challenging difficulty modes.[13]\n","\n","Plot[edit]\n","\n","On September 28, 1998, 24 hours prior to the events of Resident Evil 2, most of Raccoon City's citizens have mutated as the result of an outbreak caused by the T-virus, a mutagenic virus secretly developed by the pharmaceutical company Umbrella. Jill Valentine, former member of the Raccoon Police Department's Special Tactics And Rescue Service (S.T.A.R.S.), is attacked in her apartment by an intelligent bioweapon known as the Nemesis T-Type, programmed by Umbrella to silence surviving S.T.A.R.S. members. Briefly accompanied by fellow S.T.A.R.S. officer Brad Vickers before he is killed by zombies, Jill evades Nemesis and is then rescued by Umbrella Biohazard Countermeasure Service (U.B.C.S.) mercenary Carlos Oliveira. Carlos explains that he and his group of surviving U.B.C.S. mercenaries—Mikhail Victor, Tyrell Patrick, and Nicholai Ginovaef—have set up subway trains to evacuate civilians from the city. Jill helps them reactivate power to the subway and departs on a train with Nicholai and Mikhail, while Carlos and Tyrell remain behind to find Dr. Nathaniel Bard, an Umbrella scientist who may have developed a vaccine for the T-virus.\n","\n","After Mikhail expresses his suspicions towards Nicholai over how their platoon was ambushed by zombies, Nemesis attacks the train and kills the civilians. Nicholai then betrays and locks Jill and Mikhail out, with the latter sacrificing himself by detonating an explosive that derails the train. Meanwhile, reaching the police department on the notion that Bard is at the S.T.A.R.S. office, Carlos and Tyrell learn the scientist took refuge at a nearby hospital. Carlos is then contacted by Jill, who survived the crash while being pursued by a mutating Nemesis. She manages to escape Nemesis, only to lose consciousness after the monster infects her with the T-virus. Carlos finds Jill half a day later and takes her to the hospital, finding Bard murdered along with the scientist's video entry revealing that Umbrella's board is wiping out the vaccines and any evidence connecting the company to the T-Virus. After Carlos retrieves Bard's vaccine and administers it to Jill, Tyrell discovers that the U.S. government plans to destroy Raccoon City in a missile strike to eradicate the T-virus infestation. Carlos travels to a lab underneath the hospital to find more vaccines, while Tyrell tries to contact whoever he can to prevent the missile strike. \n","\n","Jill awakens on the day of the missile strike, October 1, and pursues Carlos to the lab. Tyrell then informs her that the U.S. government will not launch the missiles if they can retrieve a vaccine from the lab within a few hours. Although Nemesis kills Tyrell shortly afterwards, Jill manages to synthesize a vaccine. She also learns that Nicholai is a supervisor hired by an unknown contractor to sabotage Umbrella's efforts to hide their involvement while collecting combat data on the company's bioweapons, including Nemesis. An encounter with Nemesis prompts Nicholai to retrieve the vaccine from Jill as he leaves her to fight the monster. Jill eliminates Nemesis with a railgun and then meets up with Nicholai at a helipad. Nicholai destroys the vaccine, acknowledging that the city's fate is not important as long as he gets paid for sabotaging Umbrella. Carlos intervenes and restrains Nicholai, prompting Jill to shoot and injure him. Disgusted by his greed, Jill escapes the city with Carlos via helicopter, leaving Nicholai behind. As the city is destroyed by the missile strike, Jill vows to take down Umbrella at all costs. In a post-credit scene an unknown individual picks up the sabotaged vaccine canister from the table in Jill's apartment.\n","\n","\n","Gameplay[edit]\n","\n","The player controls the protagonist, Leon S. Kennedy, from a third-person perspective. Departing significantly from the series' previous games, the gameplay focuses on action and shootouts with fewer survival horror elements. The camera is placed behind Leon and zooms in for an over-the-shoulder view when aiming a weapon, or a first-person view when aiming with a sniper rifle.[2] There is no crosshair for firearms; instead, every firearm has a laser sight. Unlike previous games where players can only shoot straight, up, or down, players have more options. For example, shots to the feet can cause enemies to stumble, and shots to the arms can make them drop their weapons. Players can also shoot down projectiles like thrown axes or scythes.[3]\n","\n","Resident Evil 4 adds context-sensitive controls. Based on the situation, players can interact with the environment: kicking down a ladder, jumping out of a window, dodging an attack or executing a \"finishing move\" on weakened enemies. There are also quick time events, in which the player must press buttons indicated on-screen to execute actions such as dodging a falling boulder or wrestling an enemy to stay alive. These are often incorporated into the game's many boss fights, in which the player must avoid instant-kill attacks.[4]\n","\n","The main enemies are violent villagers referred to as Los Ganados (\"The Cattle\" in Spanish). Unlike the franchise's traditional zombies, Los Ganados can dodge, wield weaponry like chainsaws and projectile weapons, and are capable of working collectively and communicating with each other. The villagers' leaders may transform into grotesque monstrous forms to do battle with the player when encountered. Other prominent enemies include the Regenerators or Regeneradores, a type of mutated humanoid creature with potent regenerative abilities; the troll-like El Gigante; and the gigantic sea creature Del Lago.[5]\n","\n","The inventory system features a grid system, represented by an attaché case, that has each item take up a certain number of spaces. The case can be upgraded several times, allowing for more space. Weapons, ammunition, and healing items are kept in the case, while key items and treasures are kept in a separate menu. Items may be bought from and sold to a merchant that appears in various locations. He sells first aid sprays, weapons, allows for weapons to be upgraded and buys various treasures that Leon finds. The various weapons each have their own advantages and disadvantages.[6][7]\n","\n","Capcom added content for the PlayStation 2 version, which was later incorporated into the PC and Wii releases. The largest addition is \"Separate Ways\", a side story which focuses on Ada Wong's involvement in Resident Evil 4 and her connection to the series' villain Albert Wesker.[8] \"Ada's Report\", a five-part documentary, analyzes Ada's relationship with Wesker and his role in the plot.[9] Other unlockable content in all versions includes the minigame \"The Mercenaries\" and short scenario \"Assignment Ada\" (using Ada to retrieve Las Plagas samples), new costumes for Leon and Ashley, new weapons, and a cutscene browser.[10]\n","\n","Plot[edit]\n","\n","In 2004, U.S. government agent Leon S. Kennedy (Paul Mercier) is on a mission to rescue Ashley Graham (Carolyn Lawrence), the U.S. President's daughter, who has been abducted by a mysterious cult.[11] He travels to an unnamed rural village in Spain,[12] where he encounters a group of hostile villagers who pledge their lives to Los Iluminados, the cult that kidnapped Ashley. The villagers were once simple farmers until becoming infected by a mind-controlling parasite known as Las Plagas.[13]\n","\n","While in the village, Leon is captured by its chief, Bitores Mendez, and injected with Las Plagas.[14] He finds himself held captive with Luis Sera (Rino Romano), a former police officer in Madrid, and former Los Iluminados researcher.[15] The two work together to escape, but soon go their separate ways. Leon finds out Ashley is being held in a church and rescues her.[16] They both escape from the church after Osmund Saddler (Michael Gough), leader of Los Iluminados, reveals his plan to use the parasite they injected into Ashley to manipulate her into injecting the president of the United States with a \"sample\" once she returns home, allowing Saddler to begin his conquest of the world.[17]\n","\n","After killing Mendez, Leon and Ashley try to take refuge in a castle but are attacked by more Iluminados under the command of Ramon Salazar (Rene Mujica), another of Saddler's henchmen who owns the castle,[14] and the two become separated by Salazar's traps. Meanwhile, Luis searches for pills that will slow Leon and Ashley's infection, as well as a sample of Las Plagas. He brings the two items to Leon but is killed by Saddler, who takes the sample, while the pills to suppress the infection remain in Leon's hands.[18] While in the castle, Leon briefly encounters Ada Wong (Sally Cahill), a woman from his past who supports him during his mission. He battles his way through the castle before killing Salazar.[19]\n","\n","Afterward, Leon travels to a nearby island research facility, where he continues the search for Ashley. He discovers that one of his former training comrades, Jack Krauser (Jim Ward), who was believed to have been killed in a helicopter crash two years prior, is responsible for her kidnapping in an attempt to get close enough to Saddler to steal his new Plagas sample.[20] Ada and Krauser are working with Albert Wesker (Richard Waugh), for whom both intend to secure a Plagas sample, though Krauser is suspicious of Ada.[21] Suspicious of the mercenary's intentions, Saddler orders Krauser to kill Leon, believing that no matter which one dies, he will benefit.[22] After Krauser's defeat, Leon rescues Ashley, and they remove the Plagas from their bodies using a specialized radiotherapeutic device. Leon confronts Saddler, and with Ada's help, manages to kill him. However, Ada takes the sample from Leon at gunpoint before escaping in a helicopter,[23] leaving Leon and Ashley to escape via her jet-ski as the island explodes.[24]\n","\n","\n","Plot[edit]\n","\n","In 2009,[4] five years after the events of Resident Evil 4, Chris Redfield, now an agent of the Bioterrorism Security Assessment Alliance (BSAA), is dispatched to Kijuju in West Africa. He and his new partner Sheva Alomar are tasked with apprehending Ricardo Irving before he can sell a bio-organic weapon (BOW) on the black market. When they arrive, they discover that the locals have been infected by the parasites Las Plagas (those infected are called \"Majini\") and the BSAA Alpha Team have been killed. Chris and Sheva are rescued by BSAA's Delta Team, which includes Sheva's mentor Captain Josh Stone. In Stone's data Chris sees a photograph of Jill Valentine, his old partner, who has been presumed dead after a confrontation with Albert Wesker. Chris, Sheva and Delta Team close in on Irving, but he escapes with the aid of a hooded figure. Irving leaves behind documents that lead Chris and Sheva to marshy oilfields, where Irving's deal is to occur, but they discover that the documents are a diversion. When Chris and Sheva try to regroup with Delta Team, they find the team slaughtered by a BOW; Sheva cannot find Stone among the dead. Determined to learn if Jill is still alive, Chris does not report to headquarters.[5]\n","\n","Continuing through the marsh, they find Stone and track down Irving's boat with his help. Irving injects himself with a variant of the Las Plagas parasite and mutates into a huge octopus-like beast. Chris and Sheva defeat him, and his dying words lead them to a nearby cave. The cave is the source of a flower used to create viruses previously used by the Umbrella Corporation, as well as a new strain named Uroboros. Chris and Sheva find evidence that Tricell, the company funding the BSAA, took over a former Umbrella underground laboratory and continued Umbrella's research. In the facility, they discover thousands of capsules holding human test subjects. Chris finds Jill's capsule, but it is empty. When they leave, they discover that Tricell CEO Excella Gionne has been plotting with Wesker to launch missiles with the Uroboros virus across the globe; it is eventually revealed that Wesker hopes to take a chosen few from the chaos of infection and rule them, creating a new breed of humanity. Chris and Sheva pursue Gionne but are stopped by Wesker and the hooded figure, who is revealed to be a brainwashed Jill. Gionne and Wesker escape to a Tricell oil tanker; Chris and Sheva fight Jill, subduing her and removing the mind-control device before she urges Chris to follow Wesker.[5]\n","\n","Chris and Sheva board the tanker and encounter Gionne, who escapes after dropping a case of syringes; Sheva keeps several. When Chris and Sheva reach the main deck, Wesker announces over the ship's intercom that he has betrayed Gionne and infected her with Uroboros. She mutates into a giant monster, which Chris and Sheva defeat. Jill radios in, telling Chris and Sheva that Wesker must take precise, regular doses of a serum to maintain his strength and speed; a larger or smaller dose would poison him. Sheva realizes that Gionne's syringes are doses of the drug. Chris and Sheva follow Wesker to a bomber loaded with missiles containing the Uroboros virus, injecting him with the syringes Gionne dropped. Wesker tries to escape on the bomber; Chris and Sheva disable it, making him crash-land in a volcano. Furious‚ Wesker exposes himself to Uroboros and chases Chris and Sheva through the volcano. They fight him, and the weakened Wesker falls into the lava before Chris and Sheva are rescued by a helicopter, which is piloted by Jill and Stone. As a dying Wesker attempts to drag the helicopter into the volcano, Chris and Sheva fire rocket-propelled grenades at Wesker, killing him.[6] In the game's final cutscene, Chris wonders if the world is worth fighting for. Looking at Sheva and Jill, he decides to live in a world without fear.[5]\n","\n","Gameplay[edit]\n","\n","Resident Evil 5 is a third-person shooter with an over-the-shoulder perspective.[7] Players can use several weapons including handguns, shotguns, automatic rifles, sniper rifles, and grenade launchers, as well as melee attacks. Players can make quick 180-degree turns to evade enemies.[8] The game involves boss battles, many of which contain quick time events.[9]\n","\n","As in its predecessor Resident Evil 4, players can upgrade weapons with money and treasure collected in-game and heal themselves with herbs, but cannot run and shoot at the same time.[9] New features include infected enemies with guns and grenades,[8] the ability to upgrade weapons at any time from the inventory screen without having to find a merchant, and the equipping of weapons and items in real-time during gameplay.[9] Each player can store nine items. Unlike the previous games, the item size is irrelevant; a herb or a grenade launcher each occupy one space, and four items may be assigned to the D-pad.[7] The game features puzzles, though fewer than previous titles.[10][11]\n","\n","Resident Evil 5 is the first game in the Resident Evil series designed for two-player cooperative gameplay.[12] The player controls Chris, a former member of the fictional Special Tactics and Rescue Service (STARS) and member of the BSAA, and a second player can control Sheva, who is introduced in this game. If a person plays alone, Sheva is controlled by the game's artificial intelligence (AI). When the game has been completed once, there is an option to make Sheva the primary character.[9] Two-player mode is available online or split screen with a second player using the same console. A second player joining a split screen game in progress will make the game reload the last checkpoint (the point at which the game was last saved); the second player joining an online game will have to wait until the first player reaches the next checkpoint, or restarts the previous one, to play.[7] In split-screen mode, one player's viewpoint is presented in the top half of the screen, and the other in the bottom half, but each viewpoint is presented in widescreen format, rather than using the full width of the screen, resulting in unused space to the left and right of the two windows.[8] If one player has critical health, only their partner can resuscitate them, and they will die if their partner cannot reach them. At certain points, players are deliberately separated. Players can trade items during gameplay, although weapons cannot be traded with online players.[7] The game's storyline is linear, and interaction with other characters is mostly limited to cutscenes.[10][11]\n","\n","A version of the Mercenaries minigame, which debuted in Resident Evil 3: Nemesis, is included in Resident Evil 5.[13] This minigame places the player in an enclosed environment with a time limit. Customized weapons cannot be used and players must search for weapons, ammunition, and time bonuses while fighting a barrage of enemies,[9] to score as many points as possible within the time limit.[14] The minigame multiplayer mode was initially offline only; a release-day patch needed to be downloaded to access the online multiplayer modes.[15] Mercenaries is unlocked when the game's story mode has been completed.[14]\n","\n","\n","Gameplay[edit]\n","\n","Resident Evil 6 allows players to select between four scenarios with interwoven storylines centered on Division of Security Operations (DSO) agent Leon S. Kennedy, Bioterrorism Security Assessment Alliance (BSAA) Captain Chris Redfield, mercenary Jake Muller and spy Ada Wong.[5] In the Leon, Chris and Jake scenarios, players have the option of controlling either them or their respective partners, United States Secret Service agent Helena Harper, BSAA sniper Piers Nivans and DSO agent Sherry Birkin. The character not selected by the player is controlled by either artificial intelligence (AI) or another player via local or online multiplayer. Ada's scenario can be played with or without a partner and a second player who joins will control the non-canonical character Agent. In addition, each scenario features a different play-style; for example, some player-characters are more vulnerable to attacks whereas others are more resilient.[6] Each central character has unique abilities, which vary from faster reload times and carrying more ammunition.[5] Resident Evil 6 presents new gameplay mechanics such as rolling in any direction and running while shooting and sliding.[7] The game also features a four-player co-operative mode.[8] When playing in single player mode, the player can allow another player to join in online at any time.[9] While performing certain actions, quick time events may occur, in which the player must follow onscreen prompts by pressing buttons or manipulating joysticks within a limited amount of time.[6]\n","\n","A new feature comes in the form of tablets; players may consume them in order to recover health, and more can be produced by mixing herbs.[5] If one player runs out of health, that player will have a short time to try to defend themselves while their partners attempt to revive them. If any non-AI players are killed, gameplay will resume at the last checkpoint. The game features several primary enemies, including zombies and the newly introduced J'avo. Unlike zombies, J'avo are able to interact with each other to plan an attack, use weapons and heal themselves.[10] Also some J'avo are susceptible to various mutations that increase their prowess in battle, the type of mutation sometimes depends on location of the injury. There are a total of 15 different mutations within the game.[11] Certain enemies drop skill points when killed, which can be picked up and spent on upgrades such as increased weapon effectiveness or specific ammunition drops. The campaigns feature a \"Lone Wolf\" ability which allows the player to remove their artificial intelligence companion character.[12] Players can equip three of these upgrades which apply to all campaigns.[13] The game also features a stamina bar; which depletes once the player performs melee attacks, or uses a \"quickshot\"—which involves shooting a zombie with a headshot instantly.[14] Resident Evil 6 is twice as long as Resident Evil 5.[15]\n","\n","The game features two new modes. \"Mercenaries\" mode involves players fighting for survival against hordes of enemies. In the PC version, the Mercenaries mode features an exclusive sub-mode named \"No Mercy\", which involves the cast from Left 4 Dead 2 fighting a total number of 300 enemies against a timer.[16] \"Agent Hunt\" mode allows players to take control of random enemies in other people's online sessions; however, it is only unlocked after the player clears the three main campaigns. The longer the player stays in another online session, the more points they will earn.[17]\n","\n","Plot[edit]\n","\n","On 24 December 2012, Jake Muller (Troy Baker), son of late bio-terrorist Albert Wesker, flees local authorities during a bio-terrorist attack in Edonia. He partners with Division of Security Operations (DSO) agent and Raccoon City survivor Sherry Birkin (Eden Riegel) and learns that she is to extract him from the country to create a vaccine for the new C-virus. However, they are hunted by Ustanak, a hulking bio-weapon. Meanwhile, a Bio-terrorism Security Assessment Alliance (BSAA) strike team led by Chris Redfield (Roger Craig Smith) and Piers Nivans (Christopher Emerson) is deployed to combat the infected local populace. However, they are attacked by the leader of Neo-Umbrella, who refers to herself as Ada Wong (Courtenay Taylor); she kills most of the BSAA members, using a device that injects them with the C-virus, turning them into monsters, except Chris and Piers. Chris goes into a self-imposed exile, afflicted with post-traumatic amnesia. Meanwhile, Sherry and Jake's extraction by the BSAA is sabotaged, forcing them to crash into the mountains. They are captured by \"Ada\" for six months.\n","\n","On 29 June 2013, US President Adam Benford (Michael Donovan) attempts to publicly reveal the truth behind the 1998 Raccoon City incident and the government's dealings with Umbrella, to end further bio-terrorist activity. However, the venue in the American town of Tall Oaks is hit by another attack, infecting the President; the sole survivors, DSO agent and Raccoon City survivor Leon S. Kennedy (Matthew Mercer) and United States Secret Service agent Helena Harper (Laura Bailey), are forced to kill him. The pair encounter the real Ada Wong (also Taylor), and Leon learns that National Security Advisor Derek Simmons (David Lodge) is affiliated with Neo-Umbrella and was responsible for the attack. Leon and Helena pursue Simmons into Lanshiang, China, while faking their deaths. Meanwhile, Jake and Sherry escape captivity in Lanshiang.\n","\n","Chris returns to duty in the BSAA with Piers and a new team, arriving in a besieged Lanshiang. Chris recovers from his amnesia and seeks revenge against Ada, resulting in casualties for his squad. Chris and Piers confront \"Ada\", until Leon intervenes. After being informed by Leon, Chris and Piers pursue \"Ada\" to an aircraft carrier, destroying cruise missiles laden with the C-virus. Leon, Helena, Sherry and Jake confront Simmons over his involvement with the outbreaks, where Sherry covertly hands Jake's medical data to Leon in case of their captivity. Leon and Helena corner Simmons, who has been infected by a J'avo, where he confesses to having killed the President to maintain national security. The two see off a mutated Simmons while Sherry and Jake are captured again. Attempting to leave the city, Leon and Helena are warned by Chris that a missile carrying the C-virus has been launched, and its detonation unleashes an outbreak in the city. Leon discloses Jake's real identity to Chris and has him rescue Jake and Sherry in a remote oil platform. With Ada's assistance, Leon and Helena kill Simmons.\n","\n","On the oil platform, Chris and Piers head underground, freeing Jake and Sherry from captivity before preventing a large-scale attack by a gigantic bioweapon, Haos. Heavily wounded and in a desperate attempt to save Chris, Piers injects himself with the C-virus to help turn the tide of the battle. He defeats Haos before evacuating. Aware that the mutation will worsen, Piers sacrifices himself by pushing Chris to an escape pod, using his abilities to destroy the base. Meanwhile, Jake and Sherry escape the facility and kill Ustanak as they ride a rocket-powered lift to the surface.\n","\n","The imposter Ada was a scientist named and now revealed Carla Radames, who was forced to transform into Ada by Simmons. The real Ada was aiding Leon and Sherry while destroying the Neo-Umbrella lab in Lanshiang. Although presumed dead after being shot by one of Simmons' soldiers, Carla attempts a final attack against Ada, after having injected herself with a powerful dose of the C-virus, but is killed. Ada aids Leon and Helena in their battle with Simmons to kill him, and destroys the lab where her clone was developed before accepting a new assignment. Leon and Helena are cleared for duty; Chris remains with the BSAA in command of a new squad, overcoming his guilt; Sherry continues her duty as a DSO agent; and Jake starts a new life fighting B.O.W.s in an underdeveloped country with his identity covered up by the BSAA.\n","\n","\n","None\n","None\n","Gameplay[edit]\n","\n","Resident Evil: Revelations is a survival horror game where the player must complete a series of scenarios collected together into episodes.[1] Although most scenarios involve the player controlling Jill Valentine aboard a ghost ship, some require the player to control other characters in different settings.[2] To progress through a scenario, the player must complete a number of objectives, ranging from solving puzzles to defeating bosses, collecting keys that open doors to new areas, and reaching a specific point in the game.[2]\n","\n","As a survival horror game, Revelations emphasizes survival, evasion, and exploration over fast-paced combat by providing the player with limited ammunition, health, and movement speed. The player has the ability to run, climb ladders, swim and dive underwater for a limited period of time.[2] Up to three firearms can be carried at one time, in addition to grenades and the standard combat knife. Firearms range from handguns to shotguns, submachine guns and rifles.[3] The game is played from a third-person perspective, but switches into a first-person or over-the-shoulder perspective—depending on which platform the game is played on—when aiming a firearm to shoot enemies.[4]\n","\n","As Valentine, the player can upgrade firearms by finding special items throughout the game.[3] The player may also perform melee attacks when an enemy has been stunned after being shot at the right time. Ammunition and health items are dispersed throughout the game to help players manage their resources.[3] A device called Genesis can be used to scan and find hidden items in nearby environments.[4] An automap feature is available to help players navigate the game.[3]\n","\n","In addition to the game's single-player campaign, Revelations features a more action-oriented mode, called Raid Mode, where one or two players may fight their way through a selection of altered scenarios from the single-player campaign.[5] These usually feature enemies of varying power for the player to defeat. Once a scenario has been completed, the player is rewarded with experience and battle points that can be exchanged for various weapons and items at a store. Gaining experience and acquiring new equipment allow players to progress to higher and more challenging scenarios.[5] As the player progresses throughout the game, the player may also unlock numerous characters for use in both the single-player campaign and Raid Mode, with each character having a different set of abilities and melee attack.[6] The game supports a StreetPass functionality that allows different players to exchange items for use in the game.[7]\n","\n","Plot[edit]\n","\n","Shortly after the events of Resident Evil 4 in 2004, the bioterrorist organization Il Veltro launches an attack upon the Mediterranean city of Terragrigia, using biological organic weapons (BOWs), in opposition to the city's development of solar energy relay system that provides it with power via an orbital satellite. The Federal Bioterrorism Commission (FBC) attempts to maintain control over the city as it is plunged into chaos, but the overwhelming attack prompts FBC director Morgan Lansdale to use the satellite to torch the city in intense solar energy. FBC agents Parker Luciani and Jessica Sherawat oversee the evacuation of the FBC's base and escape before Terragrigia is destroyed by solar rays. A year later, Parker and Jessica join the Bioterrorism Security Assessment Alliance (BSAA).\n","\n","After BSAA agent Jill Valentine and Parker investigate a possible resurgence of BOWs near the ruins of Terragrigia, BSAA head Clive R. O'Brian reports that their colleagues Chris Redfield and Jessica went missing while investigating rumors of Veltro's possible reappearance. The pair are sent to investigate their last known position, which is an abandoned cruise ship called the Queen Zenobia. Searching the ship, the pair are tricked into believing Chris is being held in a room, and are rendered unconscious. Meanwhile, Chris and Jessica confirm that Veltro is operating at an airstrip in the mountains. O'Brian then orders the pair to track down Jill and Parker after discovering that he had given them false intel regarding their colleagues, and sends two other BSAA agents, Quint Cetcham and Keith Lumley, to investigate the airstrip.\n","\n","After awakening in separate rooms, Jill and Parker reunite and encounter FBC agent Raymond Vester, who refuses to explain his presence on the ship. The pair also witness a video from Veltro, who reveal their plan to infect one-fifth of the Earth's oceans with the T-Abyss—a new strain of T-virus—in retaliation to the destruction of their forces in Terragrigia by the FBC. Chris and Jessica reach the Zenobia and reunite with Jill and Parker. They are confronted by Raymond disguised as a Veltro agent, but Jessica shoots him. The group separates, with Jill and Chris working together to find the laboratory used to manufacture the T-Abyss aboard the ship. In the laboratory, they neutralize the virus and are confronted by Lansdale via a video uplink, revealing that he worked with Veltro in the Terragrigia panic to increase the FBC's funding and international influence. Meanwhile, Parker turns his gun on Jessica after he secretly learned from Raymond that she is a mole for the FBC, prompting her to trigger the ship's self-destruct sequence and escape.\n","\n","Although Jill and Chris escape the ship before its destruction, Parker falls off a catwalk. O'Brian reveals that he had orchestrated the events they had been through to uncover evidence of Lansdale's involvement in the attack on Terragrigia. Data recovered by Keith and Quint reveals that Lansdale sank a sister ship within the ruins of Terragrigia to eliminate any incriminating evidence. Lansdale arrests O'Brian, while Jill and Chris go to the sister ship, where they find Veltro's leader Jack Norman and learn he survived the solar ray blast by injecting himself with T-Abyss, plotting to expose Lansdale by releasing video footage of his meetings with Veltro, but had grown delusional since then. The pair defeat Norman and take his video evidence, which they broadcast. As a result, O'Brian is released and the FBC is dissolved. Parker is found a month later in Malta, after Raymond was found to have faked his death and saved him from the ship's destruction. In a post-credits scene, Raymond gives Jessica a sample of the T-Abyss at a cafe. When asked why he saved Parker, he responds, \"I have my reasons.\"\n","\n","\n","Gameplay[edit]\n","\n","Resident Evil: Revelations 2 is set between the events of Resident Evil 5 and Resident Evil 6.[6] Claire Redfield is the main protagonist and Barry Burton's daughter, Moira, plays a supporting role.[7] In December 2014, a new trailer revealed Barry as another playable protagonist and he is joined by Natalia Korda, a little girl with supernatural abilities. The official cinematic trailer was released in December 2014.[8] Resident Evil: Revelations 2 is a survival horror game which supports cooperative gameplay. When played in single player mode, the player must switch characters to solve puzzles and do certain actions.[9][10] The game has stealth elements as only two of the four playable characters use guns. The other two are more vulnerable, preferring to use melee weapons such as crowbars and bricks; they can also find hidden items with a flashlight or special senses.\n","\n","The game features a Raid Mode, which returns from the first Revelations game with new features, more missions and new playable characters. About 200 missions and 15 characters are featured, which span the entire game series, and there are also new scenarios and enemies from Resident Evil 5, Resident Evil 6 and Resident Evil: Revelations. In this mode, players can customize their skills and weapons, as well as buy new ones. Some enemies in Raid Mode have special abilities like extra speed or strength. This mode can be played either solo, online or through split-screen local co-op.[11]\n","\n","Plot[edit]\n","\n","The storyline is composed of four episodes divided into a past scenario with Claire Redfield and Moira Burton and a present scenario with Barry Burton.\n","\n","Claire Redfield and Moira Burton, daughter of Barry Burton, work for biohazard prevention agency TerraSave. While attending an office party, they and several other TerraSave members are captured by armed mercenaries. Claire and Moira are taken to a facility on Sejm Island, where they are attacked by the \"Afflicted\", mutated humans driven insane by torturous experiments. An unknown woman calling herself the \"Overseer\" watches via cameras and tells them the bracelets on their wrists record fear, as the pair try to find safety. Upon reaching a radio tower, they call for help. \n","\n","Responding to Moira's distress call, Barry tracks her to the island. He immediately meets Natalia Korda, a strange little girl with the ability to sense monsters before they become a threat. She accompanies him on the way to the radio tower, navigating through hordes of Uroboros-infected mutants. Upon reaching the tower, Barry realizes the distress call was actually made six months ago. After suffering a severe headache, Natalia claims that Moira is dead.\n","\n","Claire and Moira meet up with their co-workers, Gabriel Chavez and Pedro Fernandez, at the \"Wossek\", a derelict pub located in an abandoned fishing village. The Overseer explains that they have become her new test subjects for T-Phobos, a virus that responds to fear, for process of elimination. Gabe leads Claire to a broken helicopter he intends to repair in order to escape the island, but they are soon ambushed by a horde of Afflicted, separating Claire, Moira, and Pedro from Gabe and the helicopter; Pedro succumbs to fear and is transformed into a monster. Claire and Moira fend off both Pedro and the Afflicted until their boss, Neil Fisher, arrives to help them escape. They decide to make their way to the Overseer's tower, but are once again ambushed and Neil stays behind to lure the monsters away. Claire and Moira catch up to Natalia, who has been roaming the island alone, and they befriend her. Gabe fixes the helicopter and attempts to escape, but the Overseer remotely sabotages the controls, killing him. As Claire and Moira are distracted by the crash, Natalia is kidnapped and taken to the Overseer, who intends to transfer her consciousness into the little girl.\n","\n","Six months later, Natalia takes Barry to the Overseer's tower, the last place she saw Moira alive. Along the way, Barry learns Natalia is an orphan whose parents died in the Terragrigia incident, the trauma having left her immune to fear. Inside the tower, they find a portrait depicting Albert Wesker and a woman who Natalia identifies as Alex Wesker. The two are then ambushed by the Overseer, a grotesque hunchbacked figure who neutralizes Barry and is revealed to be Alex herself.\n","\n","Claire and Moira follow a note supposedly left by Neil to meet him at a nearby factory, only to walk into a series of traps they narrowly survive. After passing through the sewers, the pair gain access to the Overseer's tower, where they witness a meeting between Neil and Alex Wesker. It is revealed that Neil, a former member of the FBC, was behind his employees' abduction to aid Alex in exchange for a sample of the Uroboros Virus, intending to use it to restore the FBC. Alex injects Neil with Uroboros instead, causing him to mutate into a hulking monstrosity. Claire and Moira are forced to kill him.\n","\n","Six months later, Barry and Natalia escape from a mutated Alex and work their way from the sewer back to the surface. As they go, Barry tells Natalia about a tragic event concerning his two daughters; Moira accidentally shot her younger sister Polly when they were playing with one of Barry’s guns. Although the fault was his, Barry blamed Moira for the accident, causing a huge strain on their relationship. Polly survived, but Moira developed a fear of guns as a result of the incident. Afterwards, Barry and Natalia travel through a dilapidated mine infested with monsters. Alex ambushes them on the other side and throws Barry into a ravine, but when she tries to kill Natalia, the little girl impassively stares back into her eyes, causing Alex to withdraw in terror.\n","\n","After Neil's demise, Claire and Moira make their way up to the Monument to confront Alex, and the duo learn of her intentions to conquer fear and escape death. She shoots herself in the head, triggering a self-destruct sequence that causes Claire and Moira to flee. Unbeknownst to them, Alex experiences fear in her last living moments and begins to mutate. As they descend the crumbling tower, Moira sacrifices herself so that Claire can escape; she is rescued shortly afterwards. She regretfully tells Barry that she could not save Moira, but Barry refuses to accept his daughter's death and continues to search for her.\n","\n","Six months later, Barry and Natalia pass through several toxic mine tunnels before reaching Alex's research facility, disguised as a mansion. They make their way through as Alex taunts Natalia through the girl's bracelet. When the duo confront her, Alex injects herself with an Uroboros sample and mutates a second time to fight Barry and Natalia. After feigning her own death, Alex suddenly springs to life and incapacitates Barry. She grabs Natalia and once again attempts to kill her. At this point, the story proceeds to one of two endings.\n","\n","\n","Gameplay[edit]\n","\n","Like its predecessor, Resident Evil 7: Biohazard, Resident Evil Village uses a first-person perspective. It is set in a snowy explorable Eastern European village, in Romania, described as \"pulled straight from the Victorian era\" and much larger and more immersive than its predecessor.[1] Structures and buildings in the central village can be climbed and used to fight enemies.[1] Compared to Biohazard, the game is more action focused, with protagonist Ethan Winters now equipped with more combat skills due to military training.[2] The game's primary enemies, the werewolf-like Lycans, are not only agile and intelligent, but can wield weapons and attack in packs, forcing the player to rethink their strategy on whether to use sparse ammunition, use melee combat, or simply run away.[3][4][5] Similar to Resident Evil 4 (2005), makeshift barricades can be used to fend off enemies.[4]\n","\n","The inventory management mechanic is similar to that of Resident Evil 4, featuring a briefcase and the ability to move and rotate items for better storage space. Players can buy supplies, weapons, upgrades, and items from a merchant called the Duke.[6] The players can also hunt animals in the village and have them cooked into dishes by the Duke. Eating side dishes allows the player to gain certain advantages such as decreasing the damage taken while blocking.[7] Treasures and collectibles can be found around the village, and sold to the Duke for currency.[1]\n","\n","Players can manually save the game progress by locating and using typewriters, which replaces the tape recorders seen in Resident Evil 7 and marks their first appearance in a mainline game since Resident Evil 4.[8] A map of the village can be accessed from the pause menu, as well as a diary with sketches recapping the player's progress in the story so far.[4] Two new features added to the game were photo mode, which gave players the opportunity to screenshot in-game moments, and a button to skip cutscenes.[9]\n","\n","The Mercenaries Mode, an arcade-style game mode of past Resident Evil games, returns in Village. In this mode, players fight through timed stages, and purchase items and upgrades from the Duke’s Emporium.[10] Players who purchased Village also received Resident Evil Re:Verse, a six-player online multiplayer third-person shooter, when Re:Verse released in October 2022.[11]\n","\n","\n","Gameplay[edit]\n","\n","The game is inspired by Rockstar Games' Grand Theft Auto games, in that the player can complete a variety of missions within an enormous city that is open to explore. During development, around 50 story missions and 30 challenge levels were planned.[4] Gameplay elements shared with GTA include the vast assortment of weaponry, the miscellaneous shops, the ability to hijack vehicles, and the ability to attract police attention with violence and destruction.\n","\n","As a homage to numerous 8-bit video games, Retro City Rampage incorporates design elements from many different genres, and features 16 graphical filters that simulate various retro computers and game consoles. Although it is primarily played from a top-down bird's-eye viewpoint, in specific sections, it may switch to a strictly two-dimensional perspective in the style of a 2D platformer.\n","\n","The game also includes a \"Free Roaming Mode\" that allows players to freely explore the city and cause as much chaos as they can.  This mode can also be played with unlockable characters from other indie developed games: like Super Meat Boy, Commander Video from the Bit.Trip series, and Steve from Minecraft, among others.\n","\n","On February 28, the same day as the Wii release, an update for PC became available, allowing users to access a version of the game's prototype, called ROM City Rampage. ROM City Rampage is a port of Retro City Rampage to NES homebrew and emulated within Retro City Rampage. PC users received the update for free, and it was included with the Wii and 3DS versions. The update was later released on PSN and Xbox Live.\n","\n","\n","Gameplay[edit]\n","\n","Retro Bowl emulates the gameplay of American football and was heavily influenced by the Tecmo Bowl series. In Retro Bowl, the player controls the team's offense while also acting as the team's general manager. Even though the player can draft defensive players or get defensive players from free agency, the defense is not playable, and is simulated by the game. The goal of the game is for the player to manage their team to the titular Retro Bowl championship game. The game also includes aspects of managing an American football team such as trading and cutting players, signing free agents, maintaining morale, drafting players, and more. There is also, for $1, an \"unlimited version\" which gives access to editing any team's uniforms, logos and end zones, weather, and more. The player can also buy Retro Bowl's currency called coaching credits, which can also be earned by game play. All teams are based on the NFL teams in real life, but since EA still has the exclusive NFL license to the actual teams and players, Retro Bowl makes a similar jersey to the team, and puts the city's name instead of the team's name to make up for the lack of NFL license.(For example, Philadelphia instead of the Philadelphia Eagles.)\n","\n","In April 2022, an update was released that introduced being able to return kickoffs.\n","\n","In October 2022, another update to the game was released where it was made possible to simulate games and be able to change avatars for players and staff.\n","\n","In February 2023, another update to the game was released where Retro Bowl added a new mode called \"Exhibition Mode\" to allow players to pick 2 of any of the 32 NFL teams and play a game whether against the CPU or with a friend.\n","\n","\n","Gameplay[edit]\n","\n","The Obra Dinn, insured by the East India Company, went missing in 1803 as it was to sail around the Cape of Good Hope. It has since washed up in port with all sixty passengers and crew dead or missing.[1] The player is tasked with determining the fate of all souls on board, including their names, where and how they met their fate, who their killer was, and their location should they be alive.[2]\n","\n","Return of the Obra Dinn is effectively one large logic puzzle.[3][4] The game is played as a first-person adventure game, allowing the player to fully explore the Obra Dinn, using a monochromatic dithering style to mimic the shading and color methods of early computer games.[5][6][7] To help track their progress, the player is given a logbook that includes a drawing of all the crew members, the crew roster, and blueprints of the ship. They are also given the Memento Mortem, a pocketwatch-like device that can be used on a corpse. When activated, the player will hear the events that transpired in the seconds immediately before death, and can then explore the moment of death frozen in time. This is used to identify who was present, to capture moments in other rooms or on other decks, and to make note of details at the scene. These are used to help connect the faces of crewmates to their names and roles. While exploring a moment of death, the player can use the pocketwatch again to enter more corpses captured in the vision.[8]\n","\n","With each death, the logbook automatically fills in basic information. The player is tasked only with naming those present and accurately describing their cause of death. Naming the crew is done through small clues, inferences, and logical deduction – mainly, narrowing possibilities as the game progresses. The causes of death are selected out of a catalogue, and some deaths will accept more than one solution. The player can revise their logbook as they gain more information, but to deter guesswork, correct \"fates\" are validated only in sets of three, with the exception of the last six fates discovered in a playthrough, which are validated in pairs.[5]\n","\n","Plot[edit]\n","\n","The Obra Dinn, an East Indiaman trade ship, departs from Falmouth to the Orient in 1802 with 51 crewmen and 9 passengers. The ship fails to meet her rendezvous at the Cape of Good Hope, and is declared lost. Five years later, the Obra Dinn reappears off the coast of England with every hand either dead or missing. The East India Company sends its Chief Inspector to determine what happened aboard the ship. The inspector receives a logbook and the Memento Mortem stopwatch from Henry Evans, the ship's surgeon. The stopwatch, when used on a corpse, enables the user to experience and walk around the exact moment of the corpses death, frozen in time. With this and the logbook, the inspector sets out to unravel the fate of all 60 aboard.\n","\n","The Obra Dinn had launched with a number of passengers, including two royal Formosans and their guards carrying an exquisite treasure chest. Initial calamity struck after launch, with one crew member killed by falling cargo, and two others taken by pneumonia. However, a small group of the crew saw the potential of stealing the Formosan chest and, as they neared the Canary Islands, abducted the royal Formosans and the chest via rowboat and fled. However, three mermaids ambushed the boats, killing most of the group. The mermaids' attack was quelled when a Formosan used a magical shell pulled from the chest to stun the mermaids, but this killed himself as well. The remaining crew member returned to the Obra Dinn, along with the captured mermaids (who also had shells), but he was shot on approach by the surviving Formosan guard. As they were brought aboard, the mermaids attacked and killed more of the crew before they were subdued and locked in the lazarette.\n","\n","The Obra Dinn circled around to return to England due to the increasing number of deaths. As they started their return, the mermaids caused a terrible storm to strike, and a pair of sea demons mounted on giant spider crabs boarded the ship intent on reaching the lazarette to liberate the mermaids, killing more of the crew before being put down. Shortly after dispelling the first assault, the ship was attacked by a kraken, killing more crewmen and the captain's wife. The captain went to the lazarette and threatened to kill all the mermaids in hopes of ending the attack. He executed two before the final one called off the kraken. The shells and the surviving mermaid were then tossed overboard by one of the Captain's mates, with the mermaid agreeing to guide the ship back to England. The surviving passengers and some of the crew decided to abandon the Obra Dinn and make for the western coast of Africa. Evans, knowing that the East India Company will investigate the ship via the Memento Mortem, purposefully killed his pet monkey inside the locked lazarette, and kept its paw for safekeeping before leaving for Africa with the others. The three remaining crewmen turned on the captain, wanting to reclaim the chest and shells as compensation for their hardships, not knowing they were already thrown overboard. The captain killed the mutineers, and then, next to his wife's body, committed suicide.\n","\n","Several years later, the insurance inspector is able to catalogue all the deaths on the ship, except those within the locked lazarette. After the inspector leaves the ship, a fierce storm rolls in and the Obra Dinn sinks. The completed logbook is mailed back to Evans, and an insurance report is written, compensating or fining the estates of lost crewmen, depending on their conduct. A year later, Jane Bird, one of the survivors who fled with Evans, mails the book back to the inspector along with the monkey's paw and a letter saying that Evans had died shortly after receiving the logbook back. The Inspector then uses the \"Memento Mortem\" on the monkey paw in order to deduce what happened in the lazarette, thereby completing the whole story of the \"Obra Dinn\".\n","\n","\n","Gameplay[edit]\n","\n","Return to Monkey Island is a 2D point-and-click adventure game. The objective is to move the story forward by solving narrative-based puzzles. This can be done by exploring locations, talking to non-player characters to acquire information, collecting items and using them at the right time. The player controls the pirate Guybrush Threepwood, who sails the seas and visits islands.[8][9][10][11]\n","\n","The user interface is different from previous 2D Monkey Island games. Tooltips over screen hotspots guide the player's actions: when the cursor is moved over an interactive zone of the scene, a brief phrase appears, suggesting what action Guybrush will take.[12] The inventory uses a drag and drop interface to easily use and combine items[13] and the interface has been designed to work with controllers or mice.[10][8][14]\n","\n","The game includes a hint system designed to discourage players from looking for walkthroughs online and make sense \"in the fantasy\" of the game. The game also includes a simplified mode called \"casual mode\" for less experienced players.[14]\n","\n","\n","None\n","None\n","None\n","None\n","Gameplay[edit]\n","\n","Rime is played with a third-person view as the player controls a young boy who has washed ashore on an abandoned island. The player can make the boy run, climb, carry objects, and push or pull larger objects across the island's landscapes. The player can have the boy shout or sing, which can trigger certain events tied to nearby statues, such as causing a door to open for a limited length of time.\n","\n","Through these commands, the player solves various environmental puzzles. Some of the puzzles are based on the use of perspective, using a special turret-like feature to align several disparate objects to create a doorway on a surface they project onto, or trigger other events in a similar way.\n","\n","Plot[edit]\n","\n","Rime begins with a boy washed ashore on a mysterious island, with a giant tower at its far end. As the boy explores the island, guided by a magical fox, he encounters a mysterious man in a red cape on several occasions but never reaches him. During the progress of the game, the boy has recollections about how he came to the island. He and his father were at sea when a storm struck and his father fell overboard. The boy tried to save him but could only grab hold of part of the red cloak his father was wearing before the sea took him. The figure in red represents his father, leading him across the island to the far tower.\n","\n","As the boy climbs the tower, he comes to additional areas, each individually represents the five stages of grief.[4] Eventually reaching the top of the tower and exploring the area representing depression, the boy is forced to let the fox go as it disperses before him. He returns to the central tower and finds that he is now inverted within it, and climbs back through it, eventually reaching the \"top\", the initial island, now representing acceptance.\n","\n","At this point, another flashback shows that the story has actually been from the father's perspective the entire time; it was the son that had been lost at sea, and the island and tower have all been part of the father's own mind as he's coming to grips with his loss. Imagining his child having come back to him, the father goes to the boy's room and examines his various toys. As he turns to leave, a vision of his child with his red cloth appears on the bed. He hugs his son, the vision vanishing and leaving the red cloth in his hands. The father releases the cloth, finally letting go and accepting the loss of his son. \n","\n","If all four instances of the \"white shade\" throughout the game were found, a vision of the man's deceased wife appears alongside their son, hugging the pair before vanishing along with the boy.\n","\n","\n","Gameplay[edit]\n","\n","Ring Fit Adventure ships with the Ring-Con and Leg Strap, which have docks to hold the Switch's Joy-Con. These accessories are required to play the game, as the player's interactions with them are tracked by the motion controls built into the Joy-Con.[2]\n","\n","The game's main mode is a role-playing game, in which the player takes the role of a young athlete that meets a sentient Ring, and they team up to take down an evil, bodybuilding dragon named Dragaux. The player moves their character across the game's overworld and into various dungeons, where they encounter monsters to fight. Moving across the game world is similar to a rail shooter; the player moves along a fixed path by running in place, jumps over obstacles by squeezing and releasing the Ring-Con, and can fire projectiles at items by squeezing the Ring-Con in the target direction. When the player encounters monsters, the game uses turn-based combat as in many role-playing games. The player attacks the enemies by performing one of about thirty different exercises, with the amount of damage they deal based on how effectively they completed the exercise. When the monsters attack, the player can defend by pressing and holding the Ring-Con into their abdomen for as long as possible during the attack. Defeating monsters earn the player-character experience points, and as they level up, they can unlock additional exercises with more potent damage. Exercises are classified by color, each color corresponding to a general part of the body the exercise is geared towards: red for arms, blue for legs, yellow for core muscles and green for yoga positions. Monsters are also marked by colors, and exercises of the same color are more effective against them, but only after that specific ability is unlocked early in the game.[2]\n","\n","In addition to the adventure mode, the game includes a general fitness routine mode that allows one to perform the exercises, assisted by the game, but without the gamification elements. The game also has several mini-games based on certain exercises, which can be used by a single player to challenge themselves or can be used with multiple players each taking a turn to beat the others.[2] An update in late March 2020 also added a \"Rhythm Mode\", which allows the user to move along to soundtrack from the game. This mode also includes some music from other Nintendo games such as Super Mario Odyssey, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Splatoon 2, and Wii Fit.\n","\n","The game includes the option to enable only quiet exercises to avoid disturbing others nearby. For example, in quiet mode, the running-in-place in the adventure mode is replaced by performing squats.[2]\n","\n","\n","Gameplay[edit]\n","\n","Like most early first-person shooter games, the single-player mode's objective is to collect keys in order to proceed through the levels. Occasionally, special tactics and simple problem-solving skills are required to reach locations. Although most levels are fairly linear, there are some maps which have multiple exits.\n","\n","The player chooses between five characters: Taradino Cassatt, Thi Barrett, Lorelei Ni, Doug Wendt, and Ian Paul Freeley. The characters differ in three characteristics: hit points, speed, and accuracy. Taradino Cassatt is the only character available in the shareware version of the game and has average statistics: average hit points, average speed, average accuracy.\n","\n","Certain enemies can beg for their life if they take enough damage, or fake their death. Some enemies dodge the player's attacks, while others lie on the ground to ambush the player. Other enemies can shoot nets to restrain the player, or steal and use weapons from the player. There are also four bosses. All enemies are digitized actors, mostly played by Apogee employees and their friends and family.\n","\n","On random occasions, there are an especially large amount of gibs produced when an enemy is killed, presenting the player with a \"Ludicrous Gibs!\" message. The amount of gibs can be controlled through the options menu, which allows the player to set the graphics to various levels of goriness, from completely bloodless to extreme.\n","\n","There are 13 weapons in the game, divided into three groups: bullet weapons (using infinite ammunition), missile weapons (using limited ammunition), and magic weapons. The missile weapons constitute the bulk of the arsenal, and usually have a wide area of effect. Magic weapons, like missile weapons, hold limited ammunition. Players can carry a total of four weapons at once: all three bullet weapons (a single pistol, dual pistols, and a submachine gun) and either a missile or a magic weapon.\n","\n","Only one power-up can be active at once, and power-up effects last for a limited time.\n","\n","Jump pads catapult a player in the air. By stepping onto one, the player character is propelled straight up, while by running up to it the player character can make long jumps. Jump pads are often required for getting past certain obstacles or reaching a ledge to retrieve a key. They can also be used for collecting powerups and bonuses.\n","\n","Destructible objects such as ornaments or plants may block secret doors. If light poles and firepots are shot, the area dims. Glass can be shattered by shooting or running through it.\n","\n","Bonuses are awarded for various achievements whenever a level is completed. Examples are picking up all the missile weapons in a level, using all the healing items, or ending a level with minimal hit points remaining.\n","\n","Plot[edit]\n","\n","A team of special operatives, known as the HUNT (High-risk United Nations Task-force) is sent to San Nicolas Island to investigate deadly cult activity taking place in an ancient monastery. Their boat, the only way back, is destroyed by patrols, and the team soon learns that the cult plans to systematically destroy nearby Los Angeles. The operatives, now unable to return whence they came, are then left to fight their way into the monastery on the island and eventually put a stop to the cult's activities.\n","\n","During its early stages of development, Rise of the Triad was initially meant to serve as the sequel to Wolfenstein 3D, titled Wolfenstein 3D II: Rise of the Triad. The presence of the Walther PP pistol, the MP 40 submachine gun, the Bazooka, and the outfits worn by the enemies allude to Nazi Germany and imply the original aforementioned intent for the development of ROTT.\n","\n","\n","Plot[edit]\n","\n","The nameless player character is a stowaway on a small ship. Near Faranga, the ship is destroyed by a Titan, and he washes up on the shores unharmed.\n","\n","After exploring the island and meeting its inhabitants, the player can choose a faction with which to align. He can become a bandit (by joining Don Esteban), a Warrior of the Order, or a Mage. Regardless of his choice, the player character becomes involved with the plans of Mendoza, who has discovered a temple leading into the heart of the volcano. The High Inquisitor tasks the main character with gaining access to the temple.\n","\n","After the player has gathered five Crystal Disks, which activate the mechanism to open the entrance, the Inquisition enters the temple. They find the spirit of Titan Lord Ursegor, who helped the Gods imprison the Titans thousands of years ago. Ursegor reveals the presence of a Fire Titan, still imprisoned below the temple. It is revealed that the Titan's presence has been protecting Faranga from the storms and the other Titans.\n","\n","Mendoza seeks to control the Fire Titan and use it to defeat the other Titans. However, if the Titan is released from its prison, Faranga would become vulnerable to the mystical storms and would be destroyed, and there is no guarantee that Mendoza can really control the Titan. The hero rebukes this course of action, and Mendoza seals himself in the chamber with the Fire Titan.\n","\n","After the hero releases Ursegor from the curse binding his spirit to the temple, Ursegor urges him to find the Titan Lord's armor to imprison the Fire Titan, which will soon be set free by Mendoza. The armor pieces were sealed in various ruins throughout the island, along with undead priests. After assembling the Titan Lord's armor and acquiring the Titan Shield and Titan's Hammer, the hero returns to the temple and defeats Mendoza. After that, he enters the chamber, subdues the Fire Titan and imprisons it once again.\n","\n","The ending suggests that Faranga has been spared from destruction, but that four more Titans continue to ravage the mainland. After the credits roll, dialogue between the main character and Patty, the daughter of infamous pirate Gregorius Emmanuel Steelbeard, suggests that the two will travel to the mainland to fight the Titans.\n","\n","Gameplay[edit]\n","\n","The player technically has access to most of the island right from the beginning of the game. However, the paths leading further into the island are almost always blocked by numerous wild creatures that can easily overwhelm and kill a beginner character. After the player character acquires better skills and equipment, he can explore the island with much more freedom.\n","\n","Risen has smaller areas that can't be accessed until later. Creatures do not respawn in the first part of the game, but do so in later parts. The island is also said to contain easter eggs.[3]\n","\n","\n","Gameplay[edit]\n","\n","At the start of the game, the player selects one of twelve characters. Initially, one character is available, the Commando. As the player completes various in-game objectives, more characters become available. Each character has various statistics and a set of unique moves; for example, the sniper has the ability to hit creatures from a long distance for large, piercing damage but their firing rate is slow, while the commando can do rapid, moderate damage at close range.\n","\n","Throughout the game, the goal is to locate a teleporter, always placed in a random location on the level. As the players hunt for it, they will encounter monsters; upon death, the monsters will drop in-game money and will provide the players experience. As the players gain experience they will level up, gaining more hit points and damage. Money can be used to open various chests, buy items at stores, activate attack drones that aid in combat, or pray at shrines that have a random chance of dropping items, described by game lore as the space freighter's cargo. There are over 110 items in the game, and these provide benefits such as passive bonuses that improve offensive or defensive capabilities, or a special usable with a cooldown.[1] Players can only hold one usable at any time, but they can collect many passive items, including multiple versions of the same item, stacking the benefits of these items. The location of these items is randomly determined through procedural generation.\n","\n","Once the players have found the teleporter, upon activating it, it begins a timed countdown event ranging from 90 seconds on Drizzle (easy) difficulty, to 120 seconds on Monsoon (hard). During this time, many more monsters, including at least one boss monster, will appear. After the countdown is over, no new monsters will appear and the players will have to find and kill all remaining monsters on the stage before they can proceed to the next level. Upon exiting the level, any remaining money the players have is converted to experience points. At the penultimate level, the players have the option of taking the teleporter to the final level, or to use the teleporter to run through previous levels again, so as to gain more experience and items; when this latter option is taken, the teleporter on these levels will allow the same choice to either proceed to the final level or continue through additional levels. On the final level, the player must fight a final boss character; if they survive, they are able to escape the planet and win the game.\n","\n","The difficulty of the game is determined by a timer. The difficulty level increases every five minutes up through ten levels, with newly spawned monsters having more health and stronger attacks.[1] Additionally, boss characters may spawn before the players have found teleporters on higher difficulties. If playing alone, the game is over when the player dies. In multiplayer mode, a player that dies must wait until the other players survive to the next level, upon which they are brought back into play.\n","\n","The item drops are based on the various progress the player has made in the meta-game through repeated playthroughs. For example, defeating certain boss characters for the first time will unlock an item that can then drop in future playthroughs. Other items are based on completing certain goals, such as winning the game a number of times, or performing specific goals with each of the characters. In Rainstorm or Monsoon modes, monsters will also rarely drop log books that describe the monsters; this itself is used to unlock more items and a playable character.\n","\n","\n","Gameplay[edit]\n","\n","Risk of Rain 2 follows a similar approach to the first title, in which one to four players must progress several levels while killing enemies. Most survivors are locked until the player completes challenges pertaining to each one; the only survivors available at first are the Commando and Huntress. There are a total of fourteen survivors, two of which are only available in the Survivors of the Void expansion. Each survivor has their own unique set of skills, providing different approaches to gameplay based on which survivor the player chooses. Risk of Rain 2 features several of the same playable characters, creatures, and items from the first game, but also adds new survivors and most notably transitions the game from 2D to a 3D environment.\n","\n","On each level, the goal is to kill aliens while locating a teleporter randomly placed on the level; once the teleporter is activated, the players must defend themselves from a larger onslaught of aliens, including bosses, until the teleporter is fully charged. Each alien killed drops experience and currency which the player picks up. Experience is added to the player's level, and if enough is gained, the player will level up, slightly increasing their damage dealt and max health. Currency can be used to open chests found throughout the level that drop random items, or to activate turrets and drones which can either attack enemies or heal the player. Currency cannot be carried between levels, as all currency is converted to experience before teleporting to the next level. The items collected from chests offer a wide range of boosts to the players carrying them and provide both synergistic effects with other items as well as the potential to stack their effects if multiple copies of the same item are acquired.\n","\n","The difficulty of the game increases as the player progresses through a run, based on the duration of the current run as well as an initial difficulty scale set by the player. Every few minutes, the aliens' level increases, thus scaling their max health and damage the longer the player's run progresses. In the metagame, players unlock access to new playable survivors, items, abilities and game modifiers by completing certain in-game achievements; once unlocked, new survivors and modifiers become available to select from at the start of the game, and new items will start appearing randomly from in-game chests.\n","\n","\n","Gameplay[edit]\n","\n","Rivals of Aether is the spiritual sequel to Super Smash Land, a fan-made remake of Super Smash Bros., and therefore its gameplay mechanics are heavily based on the latter game.[6] Each character must try to knock the others out of a two-dimensional arena.[6] In addition to fighting game-style moves, characters can also use elemental-based attacks or passive abilities that also affect the stage.[7] This creates a meta game of not only attacking other players but also affecting the arena itself.[7] Gameplay in general favors offense more than defense compared to Smash Bros.; attacks can only be blocked by executing a timed \"parry\" rather than holding up a shield, and characters cannot safely grab edges when returning to the stage.\n","\n","\n","Gameplay[edit]\n","\n","Rive is a classic 2D side-scrolling platformer mixed with shooting elements, with the ability to shoot in full 360 degrees around the player character who gains the ability to \"alter the behavior of their robotic enemies by collecting and uploading hacks\".[5] The game features a mission system and high scores for players to come back to after completing the game's story.\n","\n","\n","Gameplay[edit]\n","\n","River City Girls is a beat 'em up brawler. The player can choose between Kyoko or Misako, who play similarly but have unique moves and animations. Two players can play a local cooperative mode with both. Waves of enemies and occasional bosses are out to oppose the chosen character(s). The player progresses through six areas in a linear manner similar to Shodai Nekketsu Kōha Kunio-kun and Shin Nekketsu Kōha: Kunio-tachi no Banka. Like River City Ransom, the player is free to return to previous areas, but they must complete certain battles and objectives to go to the new locations in their current area. In many areas where combat is initiated the first time, chains and a lock will surround the edges of the screen. At this point, the player will be unable to leave the area until all enemies are defeated. There are six bosses in the game; to be able to advance to the next area, the player must defeat the boss of the current area.\n","\n","Defeated enemies drop money for the player to collect, just as in River City Ransom. Money can be spent at various shops to purchase items, food, and gear to increase stats. Money can also be used to purchase new fighting moves from the Dojo to complement the starting basic set.

Completion of quests grant experience and money rewards to both characters, ensuring that the one that the player is not using in a single player game does not fall behind in levels or money. As bosses are defeated in the game, enemies become stronger. Upon defeating the final enemy in an area, they might surrender. The player can choose to either defeat the enemy as normal, or to recruit them. Recruited enemies can be summoned to assist the player, although only one recruit is kept at a time. The player can pick up various objects during the game and use them as improvised weapons, but they will break after being used multiple times.\n","\n","If the player loses all their stamina bar and is defeated (or both characters defeated in multiplayer), the player must restart the current room and lose a portion of their cash on hand, but their health is fully restored.[3] In multiplayer, if only one character is knocked out, it is possible for the other player to revive them by standing over their fallen body and repeatedly kicking their departing soul back into it. An angel leaving the character's body acts as a timer so that the other player can perform the revival as fast as possible.\n","\n","Once introduced, Kunio-kun character Godai will offer players numerous side quests.

While there are no \"stages\" in the traditional sense, the game's structure is completely linear and players cannot backtrack into previously-completed areas.\n","\n","Up to two players can play simultaneously. In lieu of extra lives, the game utilizes a party system in which the player can switch between different characters at any point. While Kunio and Riki are the only characters available at first, their respective girlfriends Misako and Kyoko also become playable as well throughout the course of the game. Each character has his or her own health gauge, but the game will end if the player's current character is defeated, regardless of how much health the others still have left. During a two-player game, if one player is defeated, then he will remain inactive (along with the last character he was using) until the other player either, completes the current scene, or is defeated by the enemy. Continues are unlimited and a passcode feature is available, allowing the player to restart the game at almost any scene. There are two difficulty settings as well, Normal and Easy, but the player can only proceed up to a certain point on Easy before being asked to restart the game on Normal.\n","\n","The fighting system is similar to the original Nekketsu Kōha Kunio-kun (Renegade) or the Double Dragon series. All characters can punch, kick, jump, block, and attack behind them. Initially, Kunio and Riki can only perform basic moves while wearing their prison clothes. When they switch to their school uniforms, Kunio and Riki get access to more elaborate techniques such as grappling moves and individual special attacks. The fighting styles of the female characters also differ from their male counterparts (Misako and Kyoko cannot perform grab attacks for example, nor can they be grabbed by enemies).\n","\n","Plot[edit]\n","\n","Kunio and Riki are convicted of a hit and run and the pair are imprisoned in a juvenile correction facility.

Daru is greeted by Nae, who introduces him to Kaito and the rest of the Robotics Club. Akiho, Subaru, Frau, and Junna have volunteered to help run the local Tanegashima Gun Festival, while Airi continues to live as Kaito's adopted sister. However, at the commencement of the festival, Kimijima reappears using artificial delusion technology, challenging the Robotics Club to find all of the Geotags he has scattered around the island before he initiates his plan to take over the world. With the rest of the Robotics Club having their hands full managing the festival, Kaito and Daru are recruited to search for the Geotags and thwart Kimijima's plot.\n","\n","However, the Robotics Club begin to notice that this current Kimijima seems less malicious than the one they previously dealt with, as he only seems to use his artificial delusions to commit harmless pranks which seem to only make the festival more popular. Once the festival is halfway done, Daru observes the effects of Kimijima's delusions to figure out that Daru's own delusions were unintentionally influencing Kimijima's actions. Kimijima then becomes hostile and attempts to sabotage the festival, but is thwarted when Daru uses his own powerful delusions to \"hack\" Kimijima's artificial delusion technology, buying enough time for the Robotics Club to track down and shut down the equipment, seemingly getting rid of Kimijima for good. \n","\n","With Kimijima defeated, Daru and Kaito are free to celebrate the rest of the festival with Nae and the Robotics Club. With Daru's help, Airi, Frau, and Junna are able to overcome their social insecurities, while Subaru finds the courage to make amends with his father over his dream to build robots. Meanwhile, Kaito helps Nae thwart and apprehend an assassin targeting Misaki. He also restarts his relationship with Akiho, after having put it on pause during his studies abroad. With Daru's help, the Robotics Club also rebuilds Gunbuild-2 in time for the final day of the festival, though Kimijima resurfaces in a rebuilt SUMERAGI and attacks. Kai takes control of Gunbuild-2 and supported by artificial delusions provided by Daru, Kai is able to defeat SUMERAGI. Daru then traps Kimijima in a storage device, his true objective this entire time. Daru then returns to Tokyo, where he parts amicably with the Robotics Club.

Daru returns to Tanegashima to consult with the Robotics Club, Sawada, Nae, and Misaki, and they come to conclusion that Kimijima is hijacking the world's supercomputers in an attempt to achieve technological singularity. Daru uncovers evidence that Kimijima has placed himself inside a satellite. The robotics club fights an army of rogue robots to clear a path to JAXA's space communication center, where Daru proceeds to hack the satellite. He introduces a special program called \"ANTARES\", which permanently neutralizes Kimijima and prevents him from making any more copies of himself. \n","\n","With the crisis averted, the Robotics Club celebrates, and Daru decides to bring his fellow Lab Members to Tanegashima in the future to meet them.\n","\n","\n","Gameplay[edit]\n","\n","Robotics;Notes is a science fiction visual novel in which the player follows the perspective of multiple characters, mainly Kaito Yashio. Its gameplay requires little player interaction as much of the game's duration is spent on reading the text that appears on the screen,[1] which represents the story's narrative and dialogue. The text is accompanied by 3D animated character models, which represent whom Kaito or Akiho is talking to, and background art. Throughout the game, the player encounters CG artwork at certain points in the story, which take the place of the background art and character models. Unlike the previous entries in the Science Adventure series, Robotics;Notes follows an almost entirely linear narrative, consisting of twelve chapters referred to as 'phases'. Depending on the decisions made at certain points during the game, the player can choose to skip some phases entirely. \n","\n","Throughout the narrative sequences in which the player follows Kaito, the player may activate the PokeCom Trigger (ポケコントリガー, Pokekon Torigā), which replaces Steins;Gate's Phone Trigger system and allows the player to use the applications installed on Kaito's tablet computer.[1][2] These applications include Deluoode Map, a map application; Twipo (ツイぽ, Tsuipo), a Twitter-like social networking application, which the player may use to reply to other characters' tweets with predetermined responses;[1][2] and Iru-o (居る夫。, Iruo.), an augmented reality image recognition application which the player may use to examine the environment and information tagged on characters or objects.[1][2]\n","\n","Plot[edit]\n","\n","\n","None\n","None\n","Gameplay\n","\n","Rocket League's gameplay is largely the same as that of its predecessor, Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket-Powered Battle-Cars. Players control a rocket-powered car and use it to hit a ball that is much larger than the cars towards the other team's goal area to score goals, in a way that resembles indoor soccer, with elements reminiscent of a demolition derby.[1][2] Players' cars have the ability to jump to hit the ball while in mid-air. The players can also pick up a speed boost by passing their cars over marked spaces on the field, enabling them to quickly cross the field, use the added momentum to hit the ball, or ram into another player's car to destroy it; in the latter case, the destroyed car respawns moments later on their team's side of the field. A player may also use a boost when in the air to propel themselves forward in flight, allowing players to hit the ball in the air. Players can alter their car's orientation while midair, which combined with midair boosting allows for controlled flight. Players can also perform quick dodges, causing their car to do a short jump and spin in a given direction, which can be used to nudge the ball or gain positioning advantage over the other team.[3]\n","\n","Matches are usually five minutes long, with a sudden death overtime if the game is tied at that point.[4] Matches can be played from between one-on-one up to four-on-four players, as well as in casual and ranked playlists.[5] The latter serves as Rocket League's competitive online mode, where players compete in various tiered ranks within game seasons, with victories or losses raising or lowering a player's rank, respectively.[6] The game includes a single-player Season mode, with the player competing with computer-controlled players. An update in December 2016 introduced Custom Training sequences that can be created by players and shared with others on the same platform; players are able to specify the ball's path and the presence and skill of opponents on the field as to practice specific shots-on-goal over and over.[7]\n","\n","A few months after it was released, Psyonix released an update that added game modes known as mutators, modifying some aspects of gameplay, such as increased or decreased gravity, ball size, ball speed and bounciness.[8] For the 2015 holiday season, another update replaced mutator matches with an ice hockey-inspired mode (called Snow Day), played on an ice rink and the ball replaced with a hockey puck with different physics.[9] Positive reception to the ice hockey mode led to it being extended for a few weeks after the holiday season. Snow Day was permanently added to the mutator settings for private matches and exhibition games on February 10, 2016.[10][11] Hoops, a game mode based on basketball,[12][13][14] was added on April 25, 2016.[15] A separate Rumble mode, which incorporates unusual power-ups, such as the ability to freeze the ball in place or cause a single opponent to have difficulty controlling their car, was added on September 8, 2016.[16] An update in December 2016, known as Starbase ARC and based on Psyonix' mobile game ARC Squadron,[17] added support for custom arenas for Windows players supported through Steam Workshop, along with other new content.[18] In celebration of Super Bowl LV in February 2021, Psyonix released a limited time gamemode called Gridiron, which functions similar to gridiron football with the normal soccer ball being replaced by a football.[19]\n","\n","A new game mode, Dropshot, was added in a March 2017 update. It takes place in an arena without any goals and a field made of hexagonal tiles, and uses a ball that becomes increasingly electrified after successful strikes or passes. The more the ball is struck by players without touching the ground the more electrified it becomes, and the more tiles it damages once it finally does hit the ground. The goal of the mode is to damage the opponent's floor enough to break a hole into it, allowing the ball to drop through and score. When a team scores, the floor on the opponent's side of the field resets to normal, while the floor on the scoring team's side retains any existing damage.[20][21]\n","\n","As part of a means to monetize the game beyond downloadable content, Psyonix has tried a few different approaches. In September 2016, it introduced a loot box system known as Crates, where players could purchase them with a random selection of in-game customization items, opened through the purchase of Keys using real-world funds.[16] Due to increasing governmental concern over loot boxes, Psyonix replaced the Crates system with Blueprints in December 2019, which offer a known specific item with potential modifiers as potential end-of-match drops.[22] These Blueprints can then be crafted using the game's new premium currency (Credits),[23] or purchased with real-world funds, if the player so chooses.[24][25] A new rotating Item Shop was introduced in December 2019 as well, with Featured items available on a 48-hour timer and Daily items on a 24-hour timer. The Item Shop includes all types of in-game items, such as Painted Cars, Exotic Wheels, Goal Explosions, and many more. Each item has a listed Credit value that will show the item's cost, allowing players to purchase the exact item they want, instead of relying on RNG to attain a specific item previously available through loot boxes.[26] Separately, Psyonix added a battle pass feature to the game in September 2018, known as the Rocket Pass. Each pass, which lasts a few months, has challenges and other opportunities through playing Rocket League that allow players to increase the tier of the Pass, from which new unique customization options tied to that pass can be unlocked. While the Rocket Pass is free to all players, a flat-cost premium option that accelerates the level up rate and unlocks additional items at certain tier levels can be purchased.[27][28]\n","\n","Its mobile game version, Rocket League Sideswipe, plays almost the same, except the game is now in 2D instead of 3D.[29]\n","\n","\n","Gameplay[edit]\n","\n","Rockets Rockets Rockets is set in a 2D world where the player controls a rocket while attacking and being attacked by AI and human controlled enemies.[7] The aim of the game is to try to get a three point lead against your enemy.

The game features objective-based game modes and various maps.[7] Matches consist of multiple rounds, with each round usually beginning with both teams skydiving from aircraft to the map below to compete against each other in various objectives. Between rounds players may use money earned from completing tasks and eliminating players in the previous round to buy and upgrade weapons, equipment and perks.\n","\n","A number of game modes have been revealed: Extraction is a 4v4 game mode, where the attacking team is tasked with hacking an objective; the winner of a round is determined once the objective is hacked or all players on a team have been eliminated. Strikeout is a variation of Extraction in which players are able to respawn after being eliminated, with each team having a limited number of respawns each round. In this mode, victory must be achieved via killing enemies until they have no respawns left. This can be more easily achieved by hacking the objective, an area rather than a box. Demolition is a 4v4 mode in which one team must plant a bomb within a time limit. Wingman is a 2v2 game mode, basically the game mode Strikeout but with less respawns and teams of 2.\n","\n","\n","None\n","Gameplay[edit]\n","\n","The goal of Rogue Legacy is to explore a randomly generated dungeon, defeat four bosses in each of the four unique environments of the dungeon, and then defeat the final boss. Characters have the default ability to jump and slash with their sword, along with secondary abilities, such as magic attacks, which use mana. Players can also use their sword to slash platforms to make them extend.[6]\n","\n","Whenever a character dies as a result of losing all of their Hit Points (HP), control will transfer over to one of three randomly generated heirs which the player may choose between, though this number may be increased to six with a later upgrade. Each descendant carries their unique characteristics and abilities,[7] including such genetic peculiarities as color-blindness (in which the game is presented in black and white), ADHD (in which the player moves faster) and dwarfism (in which the character is short and can fit into small gaps).\n","\n","Gold found while exploring the castle can be used to improve the character's equipment and abilities, which are passed on to that character's heirs. Gold can be found by smashing pieces of furniture, opening chests, or defeating enemies. There are also various fairy chests hidden in special rooms throughout the castle, most of which require the player to complete an objective, such as taking no damage in the room, in order to be opened.\n","\n","Spending gold on the manor, which appears after a new heir is chosen, can increase stats, such as health and mana, and unlock and upgrade new classes that may be carried by one of the heirs. These include mages, which can use more advanced spells, warriors, who have higher strength, and assassins, who can use various stealth techniques and have an increased likelihood of having a critical hit.\n","\n","Gold can unlock the blacksmith, the enchantress and the architect, who each provide their own services. The blacksmith can use blueprints found in the castle to create new armor and equipment for the player, improving their stats. Similarly, the enchantress can use runes found in fairy chests to give the player enhancements, unlocking additional abilities such as double jumping and dashing. Finally, the architect can lock down the design of a previously encountered castle (so that a new one isn't randomly generated) in exchange for a percentage of any gold found.\n","\n","Any unspent gold must be paid to Charon in order to enter the castle, though upgrades can reduce the amount required to pay.\n","\n","\n","Gameplay[edit]\n","\n","The game is a third-person shooter. Rogue's primary arsenal are his pistol and assault rifle, with the latter being upgradeable throughout the course of the game. The rifle may be outfitted with a silencer at any time, or deployed as a sentry turret. As the game progresses the player unlocks the ability to outfit the rifle with a sniper attachment, a shotgun attachment, a cluster mortar attachment, an anti-aircraft rocket launcher, and an electric beam rifle. Other weapons include deployable micro mines, incendiary grenades, scrambler grenades, fragmentation and sticky grenades plus heavy machine gun posts and flak cannons scattered across the field with occasional use of lazooka rocket launchers and hell cannons.\n","\n","Rogue's survival is ensured through clever use of the battlefield, which is generally rife with cover. He is able to fire while stationary, on the run, crouching, diving, and around the corner of any form of cover. Rogue also has the ability to unleash suppressive fire, which consumes a small amount of ammo and fires blindly from cover to intimidate enemies and cause them to find cover of their own. Enemies are highly susceptible to headshots, which will generally down them in a single strike. Another feature of gunplay is the ability to shoot an enemy soldier's air tank. Targeting the head displays a skull and crossbones, while targeting the gas tank shows a rectangular shape. Penetrating an air tank will cause enemies to run frantically and then explode, damaging any other enemies nearby.\n","\n","Rogue may search fallen enemy and ally bodies to recover Salvage, the game's main resource, and a necessity for purchasing any of Bagman's supplies. Salvage is used to create all forms of ammunition and grenades, med-kits and arsenal upgrades. Scrap piles may also be found and looted for a considerable amount of Salvage.\n","\n","\n","Gameplay[edit]\n","\n","Like the previous games in the series, RollerCoaster Tycoon 3 is a strategy and simulation game in which players manage all aspects of an amusement park by building or removing the rides, scenery and amenities, placing shops and facilities, adjusting the park's finances, hiring staff, and keeping the park visitors, known as \"peeps\", happy. RollerCoaster Tycoon 3 features two main game modes. The career mode features scenarios where players must accomplish goals, such as impressing a visiting celebrity or attaining a certain park rating. Each scenario has three levels of objectives, which are ranked as Apprentice, Entrepreneur, and Tycoon; the higher the level, the more challenging the goal is to complete. A third of the scenarios are playable from the start, with the rest unlocked when the player completes the objectives at each level. The second mode of play is the sandbox mode. In sandbox mode, players are given a large, empty plot of land and unlimited funds with which to build their own custom parks.[8] However, the land given in this mode is limited as it cannot be expanded.\n","\n","RollerCoaster Tycoon 3 introduces gameplay features in the series such as the CoasterCam, which allows players to \"ride\" roller coasters and other rides,[8] and the MixMaster, which allows the player to coordinate firework shows and time them to in-game music.[8] Unlike the two previous versions of the game, RollerCoaster Tycoon and RollerCoaster Tycoon 2, the guests, called \"peeps\", arrive in groups and show variation in gender and age, including children, teenagers and adults. A day/night cycle changes the demographics of the park's peeps; rides at night appeal to teenagers, while the daytime attracts families with children. Peeps can be harmed and injured by crashing vehicles, but will never die as they did in the previous titles, and if placed in water they will swim out. When cars derail from the tracks, they explode after a short period, whereas in the older games, they exploded on contact. Furthermore, a feature was added in which, after a cheat code was entered, people could utilize the Peep Cam from which they could see the park through a peeps' eyes.[9]  Parks now have opening and closing times, and the time of day is displayed. Scenery is divided into themes to customize parks, with western-, spooky-, science fiction-, prehistoric-, tropic (Paradise Island)- atlantis- and adventure-themed pieces.[10] Another feature is the ability to import coasters from previous games in the series into RollerCoaster Tycoon 3.\n","The game uses full 3D graphics instead of the isometric viewpoint of the previous games; this means that players can rotate and zoom the view of the park to any degree. However, there is an option to fix the camera's rotation to a preset angle, as in the previous games. 3D land shaping is also available for creating mountains and hills inside the park, as well as the ability to change portions of the land into water.\n","\n","\n","Gameplay[edit]\n","\n","The player is given control over an amusement park and is tasked with reaching particular goals, such as improving the park's value, attracting more guests, or maintaining the park rating. Some scenarios in the game provide an empty plot of land and allow the player to build a park from scratch, while others provide a ready-built park which usually suffers from deterioration, bad planning, or underdevelopment. The player must wisely invest the limited amount of money provided.\n","\n","Most scenarios require that the goals be achieved by a specific in-game date, or else the scenario is not 'complete'. Completion of scenarios is a prerequisite for unlocking further scenarios in the first RollerCoaster Tycoon game. In RollerCoaster Tycoon 2, all the scenarios are available for play and the player can complete them in any order they choose.\n","\n","The player is responsible for building out the park such as modifying terrain, constructing footpaths, adding decorative elements, installing food/drink stalls and other facilities, and building rides and attractions. Many of the rides that can be built are roller coasters or variations on that, such as log flumes, water slides and go-kart tracks. The player can build these out with hills, drops, curves, and other 'special' track pieces (such as loops, corkscrews and helixes), limited only by cost and the geography of the park and other nearby attractions. There are also stationary rides, such as Ferris wheels, merry-go-rounds, and bumper cars, most of which only contain single ride 'piece' and are very limited in terms of variation. Rides are ranked on scales of excitement, intensity, and nausea, all which influence which park guests will ride those attractions and how they will behave afterward. The player can set the prices for park admission rides and guest amenities, although care must be taken so that guests will not think prices are too high. The player is also responsible for hiring park staff to maintain the rides, keep the park clean, enforce security, and entertain guests. Players may also invest in 'research', which unlocks new rides and improvements as time goes on, though it costs money to continue research. Research in a particular category is disabled when all attractions in that category are researched.\n","\n","The guests, who are integral to the gameplay, are treated as separate entities which can each have particular characteristics and be tracked by the player around the park. The game keeps track of how much money they have, what they are carrying, their thoughts, and what their current needs are (thirst, hunger, etc.). Each guest also has some unique features such as their preferred ride intensity, and their nausea tolerance. Some scenarios are even biased towards a specific guest demographic and require the player to take this into account in designing the park. In RollerCoaster Tycoon 3, the player can create their own guest groups to visit their parks.\n","\n","Sequels have continually upgraded the number of rides and amount of customization available to the player.\n","\n","\n","Gameplay[edit]\n","\n","Roller Champions is a 3v3 competitive multiplayer sports game played from a third-person perspective. The game starts off with the ball being dropped from the top of one of the four pillars around the arena, to indicate which pillar it is falling from there is a light flashing on it. After the ball has been dropped, players can grab the ball and start rolling it around the track to unlock the net.\n","\n","To unlock the net, the team must put the ball through all 4 gates, which are indicated by a faint light and are also parallel to the pillars, without the other team grabbing the ball and changing possession (it is not required to hold the ball while going through the gates). If the other team grabs the ball, all the gates are reset, and the team has to go through the same gates again.\n","\n","If the team goes through all 4 gates without the other team intercepting, then the net will be unlocked and the team can shoot into it to score points. If the team doesn't score after going through the first lap and goes through all 4 gates once again without being intercepted, the number of points the team scores changes to 3, and if the team does it once again, it becomes 5 points. To win the game, the team must either score 5 points before the other team or score more points than the other team before the timer of 7 minutes runs out.\n","\n","After playing a match, the user gains “fans” that can be used to advance through the roller pass tiers to gain cosmetic items and unlock new arenas.\n","\n","\n","Gameplay[edit]\n","\n","\n","Gameplay[edit]\n","\n","In Romancing SaGa 2, the player plays as the Emperor or Empress of Avalon, a castle located in the northwest corner of the game's world map. The Treasurer, in the throne room, tells the player the fund reserve in his or her castle treasury. Development of new equipment and spells, and establishment of services in Avalon will consume funds. The Treasurer also fills the Emperor with walking about funds if the player needs it. Also in the throne room is the Accountant. He tells the player how much money he or she collects per battle. When the player controls more land on the map, the amount increases. In the southeast corner of the throne room is the Chancellor. He tells the player what problems need to be solved in the world and where to solve them. Solving the problems he points out aids the player to advance to the next generation. The Fighters are the default characters that join the player early in the game. They are not the best characters, but as the player advances through the game, he or she will get other characters who specialize in areas that the Fighters are weak in. The Formation Soldiers demonstrate any battle formations the player happens to know and will collaborate with the player to make new formations. If the heir the player chooses knows a formation, it is recommended that the player consult the Formation Soldiers. Throughout the game, the player will be able to expand the capital. They will not appear until the player cleared a generation though after accepting the offers to start the public works.[3][4]\n","\n","\n","Gameplay[edit]\n","\n","When the game begins the player chooses from eight characters to be the lead; additional characters can be found and recruited to the player's party throughout the game.[3] The gameplay is similar to other console RPGs of the era, but with several notable differences. For example, instead of 'level ups', character stats increase individually depending on their participation in a battle. Also, a character has a certain amount of 'LP', which decreases when the character's HP is reduced below zero or when they are hit while their HP remains at zero. If the LP of a character is zero, they are removed from the party, but they can be recruited again with the exception of the main character of the current game; if the main character reaches zero LP, it results in an automatic game over.\n","\n","During battle, characters can learn (\"spark\") new techniques which often turn the battle in their favor; the same goes for gaining the ability to evade certain enemy attacks. There is also a Commander mode, which requires at least one character more than the lead character, with the lead character on the back lines and out of the battle. If players have less than a full party of six, they may use a smaller formations (i.e. using a four-person formation with a party of five so the main character can direct in Commander mode.) During Commander mode, techniques that involve multiple characters can be learned, depending on the formation.\n","\n","When choosing to play as Mikhail, the player will start with a mini-war campaign, which continues as the game progresses. Some of these war campaigns must be won or the player loses the game. In these battles, the player controls a band of soldiers instead of individual characters. The player issues commands (forward, quick forward, rush, defend, retreat, morale up, etc.). The point of the battle is to advance to the other side of the map (the player starts on the right and must advance to the left).\n","\n","\n","None\n","Gameplay[edit]\n","\n","The Room is a three-dimensional puzzle game. The game has a minimal story, in which the player is told by letters of a mysterious box in a room in a house; as the player solves the puzzles around the box, more notes from the same author – one who previously had solved the mystery of the box – are found, describing the box's use of an ethereal material called \"Null\", as well as showing the author slowly descending into madness.\n","\n","On starting the game, the player is presented with the first of four puzzle boxes. The first box is offered as a tutorial to the game's controls, which demonstrate how to move around the box and interact with the features of the box. The player has a small inventory for items like keys found in compartments in the box. A key inventory element is a special lens that, in-game, allows the player to see things made from the Null element that compose parts of the box. The lens can generally be equipped at any time to see these secrets, often requiring the player to manipulate the view to align secrets into a coherent symbol. The goal is to fully unlock each puzzle box, extracting a smaller but increasingly complex box within it.\n","\n","\n","Gameplay[edit]\n","\n","The game plays as a murder mystery visual novel; much of the game is spent reading text to advance the story.[1] When the player is ready to accuse a suspect, a fighting video game-styled segment ensues.[2] Other segments include mini-games where inconsistencies must be fixed and stories put together into a narrative, similar to aspects of the Danganronpa and Ace Attorney series of games.[2]\n","\n","\n","None\n","None\n","None\n","Gameplay[edit]\n","\n","Ruiner is a shoot 'em up played from an isometric perspective.[3] The game takes place in 2091 and is set in a cyberpunk metropolis known as Rengkok.[4][5] The player takes control of a silent, masked protagonist who attempts to rescue their kidnapped brother from a failing conglomerate, known as Heaven, that controls Rengkok.[4][5]\n","\n","Plot[edit]\n","\n","Ruiner takes place in 2091 in Rengkok and its surrounding facilities, owned by Heaven, a conglomerate led by a man referred to in-game as the Boss. Initially the player character, a silent protagonist dubbed \"Puppy\" by another character, is being led by a rogue hacker named Wizard to assassinate the Boss. Before he reaches the Boss's office, the signal from Wizard to the protagonist is overridden by another hacker known only as Her. Her explains to Puppy that Wizard was contracted by another group and that his brother has been kidnapped, and urges him to track Wizard down. She leads him to a territory filled with Creeps, a group of psychotic gangsters led by a swordsman named Nerve. After fighting his way through the Creeps' territory, Nerve challenges Puppy to a duel and is defeated in battle. Earning the Creeps' leadership, they find Wizard and hack into his brain, killing him in the process and leading them to the Hanza Compound, a factory that manufactures machine parts. Her tracks Puppy's brother down with a signal leading to him.\n","\n","They are greeted by armed guards and the angry AI that manages the compound, Mother. Puppy fights his way through the Hanza facility and fights against mercenaries hired by TrafficKing, a cyborg in the form of a UFO-like device piloted by a human head, who runs the facility alongside Mother and presumably contracted Wizard. As he follows the signal that leads to his brother, Puppy battles Mother and then TrafficKing, hacking his brain to reveal where his brother is being taken; the Imagination Farms, which use human beings as hosts to lend brainpower for running Virtuality, a virtual reality device that Heaven manufactures and sells to civilians. As TrafficKing has clearance for entering these areas, Puppy and Her kidnap him to gain access to the farms.\n","\n","Puppy, led by Her and accompanied by the tamed TrafficKing, scour the Imagination Farms for his brother's signal, and are confronted by Geminus, a dual-personality cyborg that presents itself as two twin sisters that act as host to Mother. TrafficKing has been working for Geminus and it has been established that they were using Wizard to form a coup to overthrow the Boss and control Heaven. TrafficKing dies after begrudgingly helping Puppy through overheated obstacles, burning to death. Puppy confronts Geminus but is attacked by the resurrected TrafficKing, now controlling a humanoid cyborg body. Puppy kills him and battles Geminus, killing both sisters and finally finding the mechanical pod that holds his brother.\n","\n","Upon approaching it, a cutscene showing two small children leaving the facility plays, and the game cuts back to Heaven, where Puppy is restrained in a jumpsuit as two guards and the Boss, who wears a mask identical to Puppy's, approach him. The Boss reveals that Puppy was only being used for spare parts due to their biological similarity, and that he was hacked by Wizard as he could potentially be anywhere the Boss could be. Her is an independent hacker contracted by the Boss to hack Puppy and make him believe he had a brother who was kidnapped, thus leading him back to the Boss while also exterminating the people who attempted to overthrow him. The Boss remarks that he will keep Puppy closer to him, when Her makes a reappearance and reveals that she is not human and has been tricking the Boss since their agreement; she has led Puppy to Heaven to kill the Boss. Her advises Puppy to 'meet her where heaven falls' if he survives. He escapes his restraints and kills many of the Boss's guards before finally approaching the Boss himself, and, depending on a dialogue prompt, will either bludgeon him with his weapon or hack his brain. The ending shows Puppy riding away on his motorcycle to an unknown destination.\n","\n","\n","Gameplay[edit]\n","\n","Runbow is a multiplayer-focused platformer in which players aim to be the first to reach a trophy at the end of each level. Players can perform a double jump as well as perform attacks to defeat enemies or gain extra reach whilst jumping. The background of each level constantly shifts between a cycle of colors, causing obstacles of the same color as the background, such as blockades and spikes, to disappear. By using the Wii Remote's connectivity to utitlise the Wii Nunchuk or Wii Classic Controllers in addition to itself, the game is capable of supporting up to nine players.[2] The game will support many features such as achievements, time trials, a special mode called \"Master the Bowhemoth\", and many more. There is also character customization, as well as other modes that are not racing-focused, such as \"King of the Hill\" and \"Arena\".[3]\n","\n","\n","Gameplay[edit]\n","\n","Like the other Rune Factory games, the story begins with a character (Micah) who has lost his memory showing up in a small town. He is greeted by a girl (Shara), and is tasked with raising the town's farm. There are multiple avenues to make money, such as growing crops, fishing, and foraging. In addition, there are dungeons to explore. Micah can fight these monsters, and certain monsters can be tamed.\n","\n","The game features new AI with dynamic schedules, as well as new battle commands and NPC interaction. Other changes in the game include: the player can transform into a golden Wooly (bipedal sheep-like creatures), plants can be grown underground under a special tree that Micah lives in, villagers can now join you in battle and lend you their skills as battle companions, and the game's new multiplayer mode lets up to three players work together to conquer dungeons with rare items and monsters more interactively than the previous games.\n","\n","Plot[edit]\n","\n","Tasked with raising the farm around the massive Sharance Tree, Micah discovers that for reasons unknown the tree has not bloomed for fifty years, and since then the land started decaying. After recovering the ability to transform into a golden wooly, he discovers that he is a half-monster and decides to keep his true nature a secret from the other villagers. He also makes contact with a Univir settlement located in a desert, but only interacts with them in his wooly form, hiding his human persona from them. He learns that both the villagers and the Univir had a friendly relationship in the past, but since a few decades before, they started to estrange each other. However, Micah eventually gains each faction's trust and manages to have them settle their differences and resume their peaceful coexistence after regaining his memory which was sealed in mysterious orbs and unlocked after defeating bosses and revealing his secret to them.\n","\n","When Micah finally becomes engaged with one of the game's heroines, his bride mysteriously disappears on their wedding day and he sets into a ruin located on the outskirts of the village to find her. Reaching the deepest part of the ruins, Micah is forced to confront Aquaticus, a large water dragon who is keeping his lover imprisoned, claiming that humans and Univir should never become together and he, a half-monster should not marry into neither race. Seeing Micah's determination to fight for his bethroed, Aquaticus reveals that all was part of his plan to have both humans and Univir truly reconciled as only then the Sharance Tree could be fully restored to prevent the world's destruction. The game ends with Micah's marriage with his bride and the Sharance Tree in full bloom once more.\n","\n","\n","Gameplay[edit]\n","\n","Features common to previous games in the Rune Factory series, including farming, dungeon exploring, and marriage, return in Rune Factory 4.\n","\n","Crafting is one of the main features in the series, with which all equipment used by the main character is created. From shoes to many types of weapons, crafting materials of various stats to form new equipment is the key to character progression - more so than the traditional leveling up feature that most RPGs rely on.\n","\n","Rune Factory 4 adds the ability to make \"Orders\".

There is a set amount of gold in each level, and each bar collected increases the player's score. One of the more important collectables are the Mode-Ups, a less common object across all three games in the series that progresses the level's music while also allowing the player to attain a higher score. The five modes in Runner3 (Hyper, Mega, Super, Ultra, and Extra) remain the same as in the previous games, with the player starting at Hyper and increasing one level per Mode-Up item collected. Notably, in previous Runner games, the Mode-Up appeared as a red 3D plus; in Runner3, it appears as a blue boombox. Runner3 also includes a completely new collectible, Gems, which can be found on an alternate, more difficult path that usually forces the player to skip gold bars, requiring multiple runs per level for the player to get full completion. Each Gem can be collected only once and are used to unlock cosmetic items.\n","\n","Runner3 introduces new mechanics such as rideable vehicles and the ability to double jump. While previous Runner games split levels into different routes by allowing the player to either jump onto a vertical platform or slide under it, Runner3 makes use of alternate paths that branch off to the side, letting the player select the path to take simply by inputting a direction. The game also features side-quests, called Hero Quests, in which CommanderVideo stops to interact with non-playable characters[3] that, for example, might task him with collecting specific items in certain levels. Completing Hero Quests unlocks new playable characters; in addition to past characters from the Bit.Trip series, Runner3 includes playable versions of the Shovel Knight character from the game of the same name, Eddie Riggs from Brütal Legend, and the Narrator, a caricature of voice actor Charles Martinet.[4]\n","\n","There are 27 main levels (each containing many branching paths, collectibles, and secrets), and three main worlds (Foodland, Spookyland, and Machineland) with differently themed scenery between each world.\n","\n","\n","None\n","Plot[edit]\n","\n","Yaichi Kuzuryū is a prodigy shogi player who won the title of Ryūō at the age of 16.

These include guards (who can use hand to hand combat and guns) who stand still and will chase and attack the saboteur if they see him or if he makes too much sound. The guards are assisted by guard dogs and automatic gun emplacements.\n","\n","Saboteur! also has a difficulty level selection that can be chosen before a game begins. The chosen difficulty level determines how many guards are on watch, how much time the saboteur has to complete his mission, and how easy the route to the disk and helicopter will be (i.e. how many security doors on the way are locked and will need to be opened in some way).\n","\n","\n","None\n","Gameplay[edit]\n","\n","The basic concept of SaGa Frontier is based on its Free Scenario System, in which one can play as any of seven different protagonists, all of whom exist in the same setting, a solar system known as The Regions: a group of planets, each with its own culture, game-level of technology, and form of magic. The game is considered non-linear, in that from the beginning many of the characters are free to go almost anywhere and interact with almost anyone. Travel through most of the Regions is easy due to inter-regional ships traveling regularly between them. The player controls the protagonist on the field screen, a set of interconnecting pre-rendered backgrounds, and is able to speak with a slew of other characters in order to gather information, recruit party members, and initiate quests. Each character has a storyline and a main quest to fulfill, but there are also several optional quests that any of the characters can participate in. Some of the main characters encounter each other during their quests.[5] The storyline of each character also changes depending on who is chosen, what is said in conversation, what events have already occurred, and who is in the adventuring party, a concept first introduced in Romancing SaGa 2.[5]\n","\n","Players encounter groups of enemies on the field screen, upon which they switch to the battle screen. The battle screen depicts 2D-animated sprites amidst a 3D-rotating background. Battles are turn-based; the player chooses the characters' actions and must allow them, along with those of the enemies, to play out. A variety of weapons, special skills, and magic spells are at the player's disposal. Most skills are learned mid-battle, while many spells are purchased in the game's shops. If certain conditions are met within the battle, party members on either side can create combination attacks for added damage. Winning battles increases player character statistics such as hit points (HP), life points (LP), strength, and quickness. Outside of combat, players can equip and unequip (or \"seal\") weapons, armor, skills, spells, and items. First introduced in the Game Boy incarnations of the SaGa series, the game contains different races that exist within the Regions: the Humans, the Mystics, the Half-Mystics (half Human and half Mystic), Monsters, and the Mecs (robots).[6]\n","\n","The player is encouraged to complete each of the seven scenarios one after the other. For added incentive, beating a character's game and saving its completion to the system data adds some bonuses. After beating one character's game, essentially every character in the following game starts off stronger and with better gear than before, and may depend on how many battles players fought in their previous quest that they saved on the system data.[7][8] Fulfilling all seven main quests allows the player access to the \"2nd Division\" room, in which the player can fight all final bosses and talk to the game's programmers.[9]\n","\n","Plot[edit]\n","\n","At the outset, the player can choose any one of seven main characters to play as, each with their own storyline:\n","\n","The Remastered Edition adds an eighth character whose scenario was cut from the original due to time and storage constraints:\n","\n","\n","Gameplay[edit]\n","\n","The game takes place in the rural town of Sveti Kotar in Croatia, where two characters, Benedek Dohnany and Nikolay Kalyakin, uncover a series of murders that are connected to witchcraft.\n","\n","The player controls both characters and can influence the outcome of conversations, plot and fate of NPC, by choosing different dialog options and making decisions. Furthermore, the player can discover more than 110 locations, find and use special items to solve puzzles and quests and unlock subplots to learn more about the lore and background story.

Player melee attacks include running attacks such as DDTs and a purple dildo bat.[15] Players may use vehicles to navigate the city, including a hover jet (known as the F-69 VTOL) and a pixelated retrogame tank that are unlocked through story missions. Once special vehicles are unlocked, they are in unlimited supply and can be delivered directly to the player-character's location.[8] Player actions are intensified with what Volition calls the \"awesome button\", where for example the player will divekick through the windshield into the driver's seat of a car.[14] The main story campaign missions can be played alone, or cooperatively either online or via System Link offline.[8][f] Some elements are added to the campaign for the second player.[15] There is no competitive multiplayer, but a \"wave-based survival mode\" called Whored Mode[6] that supports up to two players.[16]\n","\n","Players customize their characters after the introductory mission. Player-character bodies, dress, and vehicles can be customized,[8][g] as well as home properties. Players can additionally share their character designs in a Saints Row online community.[15] Apart from the main story missions, there are optional diversions to make money and earn reputation, such as Insurance Fraud, where players hurt themselves in traffic to maximize self-injury before a timer expires, or Mayhem, where players maximize property destruction before a time expires. Some of these diversions were introduced in previous Saints Row games.[8][h] Activities serve the plot and are positioned as training the player-character or damaging the Syndicate.[14] They can also be repeated.[10] Outside of structured diversions, players are free to make their own fun by purchasing property, shopping for items, finding hidden sex doll and money cache collectibles, and wreaking unsolicited havoc.[9] There are also \"flashpoint\" gang operations that grant respect when disrupted.[12] Attacking others increases the player's notoriety level, as depicted with stars.[9]\n","\n","Saints Row: The Third introduced experience levels[12] and weapon upgrades to the series.[17] Most actions in the game come with incentives in the form of money and respect (reputation). Money buys land, weapons, and other upgrades,[i] and respect is a kind of experience point that can unlock player abilities like \"no damage from falling\" or \"infinite sprint\",[8][j] as well as upgrades to the player's computer-controlled gang member support.[6] In turn, players receive further incentive to nearly miss car collisions, streak naked through the streets,[8] shoot others in the groin, blow up Smart cars, and kill mascots in ambient challenges to earn more respect. Lack of respect does not hinder story progress, as it has in previous games.[6] Player progress and unlocks are managed by an in-game cell phone menu that also lets the player call for vehicle deliveries and non-player character backup.

The group are bailed out by Phillipe Loren (Jacques Hennequet), head of an international criminal enterprise called \"the Syndicate\" that owned the bank they robbed, and held as captives aboard his jumbo jet. After refusing Loren's deal to give him most of their profits in exchange for their lives, the Saints stage a breakout, though Gat is forced to sacrifice himself to allow the Boss and Shaundi to escape. In response to the incident, Loren orders the Syndicate to attack the Saints, and ensure that their empire is destroyed.\n","\n","Shaundi and the Boss land in the city of Steelport, firmly ruled over by the Syndicate's three main divisions: the Morningstar, a sophisticated gang led by Loren and his lieutenants, sisters Viola (Sasha Grey) and Kiki DeWynter (Megan Hollingshead), who dominate the sex trade; the Luchadores, a Mexican wrestler-themed gang led by Eddie \"Killbane\" Pryor (Rick D. Wasserman), who operate their own casino; and the Deckers, a hacker gang led by Matt Miller (Yuri Lowenthal), who dominate the city's cyber black-market. After Saints lieutenant Pierce Washington (Arif S. Kinchen) arrives with backup, the Saints secure a hideout, and go after Loren's operations, ultimately killing him in his own skyscraper. In the process, they rescue Oleg Kirrlov (Mark Allen Stuart), a former KGB agent being forcefully cloned to provide super-soldiers for the Syndicate, who helps them to track down other allies: ex-FBI agent Kinzie Kensington (Natalie Lander), who seeks to disrupt the Deckers; veteran pimp Zimos (Alex Désert), who lost his business to the Morningstar; and Angel de la Muerte (Hulk Hogan), Killbane's embittered former wrestling partner.\n","\n","Killbane steps in to succeed the late Loren as leader of the Syndicate, and soon kills Kiki in a jealous rage.

Armed with highly advanced technology, S.T.A.G. puts the city under martial law until order can be restored. During this time, the Saints focus on the Deckers, with the Boss acquiring items needed by Kinzie to allow them to access the Deckers' network with a virtual avatar. Once inside, the Boss battles Matt's avatar and defeats it, forcing Matt to retire his gang and leave the city. With only the Luchadores left, Angel and Viola suggest humiliating Killbane during his next major wrestling match, resulting in him going on a rampage across Steelport after he loses.\n","\n","While pursuing Killbane amidst the chaos, the Boss is informed that Shaundi, Viola, and Mayor Burt Reynolds (himself) have been kidnapped by S.T.A.G. and taken to Steelport's most prominent monument, which has been rigged with explosives. At this point, the player must choose between continuing their pursuit of Killbane, or trying to stop S.T.A.G. In the canon ending, the Boss rescues their allies and prevents the monument's destruction, resulting in the Saints being hailed as heroes and Monica Hughes withdrawing S.T.A.G. after its actions become severely questioned by the government. The Saints decide not to pursue Killbane, who has fled Steelport, and instead resume their consumer activities, focusing on a new film called Gangstas In Space that stars the Boss. If the player alternatively chooses to pursue Killbane, they ultimately kill him, but Shaundi, Viola, and Reynolds die when S.T.A.G. destroys the monument, which the Saints are framed for. The Boss exacts revenge and destroys S.T.A.G.'s flying aircraft carrier, before they and Pierce declare Steelport an independent nation under the Saints' rule.\n","\n","\n","None\n","None\n","Gameplay[edit]\n","\n","Salt and Sanctuary combines aspects of the metroidvania and soulslike genres.[8] The game features 2D hand drawn visuals, as well as gameplay mechanics similar to the Dark Souls series. There are 600 items players may use, and the several weapon categories have special movesets including air attacks. Players can wield two handed weapons for additional power, and shields to defend and parry. Magic and ranged attacks can also be performed.[1] The game implements RPG concepts such as origins, classes and stat development, as well as an extensive skill tree providing hundreds of combinations. The game also provides a local multiplayer option for co-operative and versus play, and asynchronous features such as messages that may be interchanged between players.\n","\n","Plot[edit]\n","\n","The game begins with the player stowed away in a ship that is also carrying a princess from an unnamed country who is to be married to an opposing country's king in order to avert war. However, a group of marauders attack the ship, murdering its crew. If the player kills all the marauders and escapes to the deck, they are then set upon by a giant \"Kraekan\" (a corruption of kraken) of the sea resembling Cthulhu. Whether or not they are able to defeat the marauders and the powerful kraeken, the ship is wrecked, sending them drifting to shore on a mysterious island.\n","\n","There, the player meets a strange old man who gives them an icon of one of three creeds the player says they are a member of, helping them in their quest to find the lost princess. The player places this icon in the first Sanctuary and then continues exploring the island, gathering salt in order to gain power, as in this universe, There are two types of human: Saltborn and Lightborn. Saltborn are ostensibly largely composed of salt, while Lightborn are made out of light. Once a Saltborn dies, they will be sent to the Isle of Salt, while Lightborns will cease to exist. Lightborns can become gods, while Saltborns cannot (This is why the Nameless God imprisons The Three and steals their prayers). There, it is possible to meet several non-player characters with side stories, an unnamed Knight, Thief, and Sorcerer. The player also meets a highly sinister talking Scarecrow that threatens that they will perish.\n","\n","In the process of conversing with these NPCs throughout the journey, they come to realize that the island is made up of copies of dangerous locations from the various continents of the world, and that some kind of power \"collected\" them. The player realizes that the Scarecrow is the avatar of a being known as the Nameless God, and also that the princess they were searching for may not have even been royalty, but rather a slave that was to be sacrificed to the Nameless God in exchange for ending the current war, as has been done many times in the past. An optional boss fight also reveals that the Nameless God has killed the current gods of the world, known as the Three, by trapping them in special coffins and receiving and answering prayers meant for them, as gods require worship to survive.\n","\n","Finally, the main character meets the old man for the final time, and he reveals that he was once Jaret, a great king who once ruled the island and agreed to be the servant of the Nameless God in exchange for power. The Nameless God is an incredibly powerful being who is Saltborn (i.e. mortal), but desires to be a divine being, yet is unable to no matter how much power he collects due to him not having a soul of fire like other gods.\n","\n","The player travels to the Nameless God's castle and defeats him, finding a well with which they are able to escape from the island and presumably end the cycle of war that the Nameless God perpetuated. Alternatively, they can choose to pick up the Nameless God's helmet and gain his full power, but be trapped on the island.\n","\n","\n","Gameplay[edit]\n","\n","Beyond Time and Space builds on Save the World with more dynamic NPCs, an updated engine, a hint system, support for widescreen monitors, more realistic animations, and more mini-games within each episode.

Sam may also engage in conversation with non-player characters; when this occurs, the game presents a dialog tree with several subjects to pick from. Topics of conversation may directly involve the story or provide assistance with the game's puzzles, while others may be entirely unconnected. In some cases, the player may be able to choose dialog for Max to speak as well.[7]\n","\n","The game implements an inventory system to allow Sam to store any items that the player picks up during the course of the game.[4] The player may select any of the items in the inventory and can then attempt to use them on objects in the game world or give them to other characters simply by clicking on the desired target.[8] Unlike Save the World's predecessor, Sam & Max Hit the Road, inventory items are context specific, and cannot be used together or combined to create new items.[9] Typically, Sam carries a gun that may be used to solve several puzzles.[7]\n","\n","The characters can travel between a variety of locations in the game using their black and white 1960 DeSoto Adventurer,[10][11] which, when selected, will present the player with a list of available destinations. The DeSoto is also used for several driving sequences, usually involving pursuing or fleeing criminals in other vehicles.[12] In these driving sequences, the player can use Sam's gun, the car's horn, or have Max attempt to communicate with other vehicles via a megaphone. In addition, special inventory items may be used to complete specific puzzles within these sequences.[9] Driving sequences are also used for several minigames, such as pulling innocent drivers over for fabricated felonies.[13] In keeping with the developer's heritage from the LucasArts adventure games, Sam & Max Save the World is designed so that the player characters cannot die or reach a complete dead-end.[14]\n","\n","\n","None\n","Gameplay[edit]\n","\n","Samurai Gunn is a local multiplayer game that supports 2 to 4 players utilising melee and shooting mechanics as well as platforming.\n","Players are armed with a sword and gun with only three bullets per life.

By pressing special combinations, the character can carry out captures, counterattacks, interceptions and evasions. The Rage Gauge is back in the game. It replenishes after each damage taken by the character. A fully filled scale gives access to new abilities. After gaining a full scale, the player can activate the rage mode, which increases the character's strength for a while and opens up the opportunity to inflict a disarming blow to the opponent. During the activation of the fury mode, an explosion occurs, pushing the enemy away and opening him up for attack. After the end of the rage mode, the player is deprived of the opportunity to use the scale until the end of the match.\n","\n","Each character has a Super Special Move, which deals very powerful damage when hitting an opponent.

Shizuka Gozen, the deceased spirit of a young woman who is possessed and trapped in Yomi, (labeled Eternity in the game itself) threatens to destroy Japan. Warriors from all across Japan and beyond the ocean, driven by their own needs and desires, converge to investigate these evil forces and vanquish them.\n","\n","\n","Plot[edit]\n","\n","The stories in the series take place in 18th-century Japan, during the Sakoku or seclusion period of Japan (the first four games run across 1788 and 1789) with great artistic license so that foreign-born characters (including some from places that did not exist as such in 1788) and fictional monsters can also be part of the story. The plot of each game is quite different, but they circle a central group of characters and a region in Japan.\n","\n","Samurai Shodown consequently portrays snippets of the Japanese culture and language internationally with little edits. For instance, unlike most fighting games made in Japan, the characters in the series (including the announcer) generally speak only in Japanese, with dialects ranging from archaic formalities and theatricalism to modern-day slang, something that has been preserved for overseas releases. Win quotes and other cut scenes provide subtitles in several languages, including but not limited to English, Portuguese, and German.

Some attacks require additional inputs to power up and all enemy attacks can be blocked with a well-timed button press.[3] While not in battle, players can discover new items to use in fights, partake in a number of side quests, and earn experience by exploring the environments. Players can also discover power enhancing Scratch and sniff stickers in the world that can be attached to their notebook. These stickers must be scratched at the beginning of battle to unleash their effects.[1]\n","\n","Saturday Morning RPG's story is structured in an episodic fashion, much like the Saturday-morning cartoons it draws inspiration from.

In some levels, the player will be prompted to press a button in time with the soundtrack to make a jump or avoid an obstacle. Other levels may require the player to move a cursor on screen to target a bow-and-arrow weapon to defeat enemies, in a manner similar to Rez.[1] During the levels, the player will encounter different boss encounters, which will incorporate a mix of movement and timed button presses to avoid attacks. The player earns points for hearts collected, timing on button presses, and avoiding obstacles, and are rated on a bronze, silver, or gold rating for each. Should the player hit an obstacle or enemy projectile, they are returned to a checkpoint.

Nettie has a prophetic dream that Legion is preparing to usher in the Apocalypse by claiming the Dark Souls – the immortal souls of damned warriors – and using them to create an immortal army and send it into Liveside. Nettie reveals that Michael cannot stop the Five, a group of serial killers recruited by Legion, without his powers. The Five, who each have a Dark Soul within them, are hiding in Liveside, where Michael's powers do not work during the day. Michael travels to Deadside with the use of his dead brother's teddy bear, which serves as a link between both worlds.\n","\n","After collecting all of the Dark Souls in Deadside and passing trials set by the gods of Deadside, Michael assembles a magic knife called the Eclipser. Returning to Liveside, Nettie uses the Eclipser to trigger an eclipse, which enables Michael to become the Shadow Man in Liveside. The ritual drains Nettie of her powers and causes her to go into a deep sleep.\n","\n","Michael returns to Deadside and finds the Asylum as well as the Dark Engine which powers it. Michael finds his long-dead brother Luke within the Dark Engine along with several paths to Liveside which lead to the hiding places of the Five. Michael defeats the Five and claims each of their souls in the process. During this time, Michael finds Jack the Ripper's diary, which contains instructions on how to shut down the Engine. Michael returns to Deadside and shuts down the Engine, giving Luke his teddy bear back. Luke reveals himself to be Legion in disguise.\n","\n","Legion reveals that he sent Nettie the dream so that Michael would be forced to collect all of the Dark Souls and confront Legion, enabling Legion to claim all of the souls at once and use them to power the Engine, creating his army and sending it into Liveside. After an intense battle, Michael gives Legion all of the souls, whose combined power overwhelms Legion and kills him, destroying the Asylum as well. However, Michael is now stranded in Deadside but embraces his position as lord of Deadside.\n","\n","\n","Gameplay[edit]\n","\n","The player must solve a series of puzzles throughout the castle to proceed to the Warlock Lord's chamber. Due to the castle's perilous nature, at least one lit torch must be in the player's possession at all times. If the torch is extinguished, the player soon stumbles, breaking his neck, and must then continue from a saved game (or the area in which they died, in game console versions). Only a finite number of torches are to be found throughout the game, which effectively acts as a time limit to proceedings. Various items that can be acquired include a sword, a sling and other ancient weapons; though these weapons can not actually be used as striking weapons, they can be clicked on at the appropriate time to deliver a fatal blow to specific enemies.\n","\n","The game has many opportunities for death, including being burned by a dragon's breath, attacked by a cyclops, sucked into outer space through a broken mirror, dissolved by acidic slime, mauled by a wolf-woman, eaten by sharks, and suicide. Virtually any action taken by the player which is not the correct solution to a puzzle will result in a fatality. These deaths were often graphically described in the game's text (along with often sardonic and humorous comments), even in the NES version (in spite of Nintendo's policy of censorship at the time). Many of the game's puzzles rely on a system of trial and error, the problem of which is overcome by the ability to save the game state (as in most adventure games). Subtle hints can be found in books and the descriptive game texts. In the NES version, these are replaced by an outright hint feature which gives vague clues about what is noteworthy in any given room in the castle. The further the player progresses, however, the more useless this feature becomes, deteriorating into nothing but encouraging messages by the game's end.

Reading the book Before Shadowgate, the comic book Shadowgate Saga: Raven, and playing the sequels Beyond Shadowgate and Shadowgate 64: Trials of the Four Towers reveals more details.\n","\n","Shadowgate takes place in the fictional world of \"Tarkus\" (\"Tyragon\" in the Before Shadowgate novel, also known as \"Terrakk”, the Kal Torlinese term for \"Earth\") where creatures from fantasy and myth live. In the land of \"Kal Zathyn\" (according to the novel), on top of \"Gatekeeper Mountain\", is the living castle of \"Shadowgate\" where a group of powerful wizards known as the \"Circle of Twelve\" once met. One of the Circle of Twelve, \"Talimar\", became corrupt and was removed from the Circle. After that, he began to call himself \"The Warlock Lord\" and caused chaos across the lands by inciting conflict between humans, elves, dwarves, and the races on Tyragon. After those wars ended and the land began to rebuild, the Warlock Lord amassed an army of followers, including trolls, orcs, goblins, and other creatures. He waged war against the Kings of the Lands, and was defeated when the rest of the Circle of Twelve intervened. They sealed the Warlock Lord inside the caverns underneath Shadowgate, and then disbanded. The only wizard who remained was \"Lakmir\", who took on the role of Tyragon's guardian to ensure that the Warlock Lord's evil would not threaten the Lands again.\n","\n","Years later, the Warlock Lord escaped from his confinement, and planned to raise the mightiest of titans, the Behemoth, from the depths of darkness to serve him. With the Behemoth, the Warlock Lord would escape Castle Shadowgate, and terrorize the planet once more. To keep this from happening, Lakhmir sought out the last of the \"Line of Kings\", also known as \"The Seed of Prophecy\", who was foretold to stop the Warlock Lord and the Behemoth. Doing so would require the \"Staff of Ages\", a powerful artifact with enough power to slay the Behemoth that was hidden within Shadowgate.  After finding this hero, Lakhmir sends him to the entrance of Shadowgate to begin his quest.\n","\n","It is up to the player to take on the role of \"The Seed of Prophecy\", enter Castle Shadowgate, solve its puzzles, survive its many traps, and stop the Warlock Lord once and for all. If they survive to the end, they will come across the Warlock Lord just as he succeeds in opening the gates of Hell and summoning the Behemoth. If the player was successful in finding and assembling the holy artifact called the Staff of Ages by this point, then they would be able to mortally wound the demon with it. As it dies, the Behemoth then drags the Warlock Lord with him into Hell.

In order to progress through the game, Shantae needs to find various transformation spells. These spells, activated by performing a belly dance, transform Shantae into various animals with unique abilities. These include a monkey that can cling onto certain surfaces and dash between walls, an elephant that can smash rocks to open new areas, and a mermaid that can swim underwater.

Mimic reveals to Shantae that three hidden magic seals are necessary to release the lamp's magic, and Shantae sets out to find them. With help from her friend, the zombie Rottytops, she learns that the seals are in possession of three treasure hunters, the Barons of Sequin Land, whom she will have to confront to obtain the seals. While she pursues the Barons, Risky tricks Rottytops and her brothers into kidnapping Mimic for her, promising them a lifetime supply of coffee needed to maintain their sanity, and particularly, Shantae's brains for Rottytops. Shantae, now in possession of the three seals, reaches them as Risky reveals her deception. Shantae surrenders the seals in exchange for Mimic's life.

Ammo Baron places Shantae under lockdown pending further punishment. Defeated and despondent, Shantae returns home, where she is confronted by her nemesis, the pirate Risky Boots. Risky accuses Shantae of robbing her, as her henchmen and items have suddenly gone missing. The two discover that Dark Magic has overtaken Risky's Tinkerbats, turning them into evil Cacklebats. Risky deduces that the Pirate Master, a powerful evil tyrant and her former captain who was sealed away long ago by Sequin Land's genies, is trying to use the Dark Magic to revive himself. Determined to stop his revival at all costs, Risky forms a reluctant alliance with Shantae to destroy the dens of evil giving him power, recover Risky's lost pirate items, and retrieve the Dark Magic inhabiting the Cacklebats. Along the way, Shantae's friend Rottytops reconciles with her for her unwitting role in Shantae losing her magic, and Risky reveals that the Dark Magic is actually Shantae's genie magic, which was corrupted and scattered across Sequin Land rather than destroyed.\n","\n","After Shantae destroys all of the evil dens, Risky attempts to destroy the Pirate Master's grave, but is kidnapped by the revived Pirate Master.

With peace returned to Sequin Land, Shantae and Risky develop a mutual respect and understanding of one another, though Risky admits that she will never be one of the good guys.

During her journey, Shantae encounters towns with non-player characters to interact with, as well as dungeon-style labyrinths containing new abilities to unlock and bosses to defeat. Shantae retains her ability to transform into other creatures, now utilized via an ability called \"fusion magic\" that allows her to instantly transform and use a creature's ability with a button press instead having to select it like in past games, functioning similarly to the Pirate Gear in Pirate's Curse. Additional special abilities can be performed by dancing, such as revealing hidden objects or healing wilted plants. Defeated enemies will sometimes drop collectible Monster Cards bearing their image. By finding a certain number of a given card, Shantae can equip it to augment her abilities, providing bonuses such as increased movement speed or magic automatically refilling over time. Up to three cards can be equipped at once, with a total of 50 different cards to collect.[5] Like other games in the series, completing the story awards the player with bonus artwork based on their final time and completion percentage.

While searching, she encounters her longtime arch-nemesis Risky Boots. Shantae accuses her of the kidnapping, but Risky refutes her, stating that she is only here to claim a mysterious treasure said to reside beneath the island, and that the others were taken by the true rulers of the island, the Seven Sirens.

She manages to rescue four of the missing half-genies, each of which transfers their magical ability to Shantae to help strengthen her against the sirens.\n","\n","While rescuing Harmony, Shantae discovers that Fillin is actually her friend Rottytops. Shantae enters an underground bunker to find her, but inadvertently activates a control panel, realizing that the sunken city is both a giant airship and the treasure that Risky Boots was after.

The Empress made a deal with Risky, offering the ship in exchange for bringing her five half-genies whose life force she could use to break the spell, restoring her and allowing her to absorb mortal life force again. However, she betrays Risky and steals her life force, restoring her youth, and announces her plan to drain the life force from all creatures to make herself immortal.

The game, which is inspired by Bak Mei kung fu, includes over 150 unique attacks. Basic attack moves can be chained together, though some combos may grant players additional tactical opportunities, such as being able to knock down enemies or stun them. The protagonist and all hostile enemy characters have a \"structural gauge\". When the gauge is completely filled, the guard of these characters will break and they will become vulnerable to finishing attacks. Players can also block strikes, though this will gradually fill their gauge. Alternatively, players can also evade attacks or parry when an enemy is about to land a blow. A successful parry allows the player to stun the enemy or throw them toward a particular direction. The game allows players to take advantage of the environment and improvise new attacks or alter their strategy when facing a stronger opponent. For instance, the player may kick an enemy off a ledge, or utilize various objects as makeshift weapons. The last enemy in a combat section may sometimes enter a state of uncontrolled frenzy, essentially becoming a miniboss.[2] Occasionally, the player may be presented with dialogue options, which can enable them to potentially avoid combat altogether depending on their choice of words.[3]\n","\n","When the player dies in the game, they are magically resurrected at the spot where they die and age several years. As the player character ages, their strikes will be more powerful, but they will have less health. Eventually, it will no longer be possible to revive, and the next death will end the game. Players will encounter shrines, which will be the place where they heal and unlock new skills. They can also visit the \"wuguan\", a kung fu school, to practice their skills in between levels.[2] Abilities are lost when the player character dies, though it is possible to permanently unlock upgrades so that they are available at the beginning of each run.[4] As the player completes multiple runs, they can access the \"detective board\", where the information collected across different runs will be stored, and secret areas and shortcuts may open up.[2]\n","\n","Plot[edit]\n","\n","On a rainy night, Yang, a disgraced student of a martial arts school in China, leads a raid on his former school along with four other martial artists: Fajar \"The Botanist\", a ferocious middle-aged man who wields a machete and never talks; Sean \"The Fighter\", an arrogant young man who wields a bo staff and regards the school's students as weak; Kuroki \"The Artist\", a young Japanese woman who wields a bladed three-section staff; and Jinfeng \"The CEO\", an elderly, one-armed woman who wields a rope dart. After defeating the students, Yang confronts the school's sifu (his former master) and strikes him in the chest, causing him to suffer a fatal heart attack. While searching through the sifu's belongings, Yang finds the sifu's only child hiding nearby and orders Fajar to slit their throat. The child later wakes up to find their throat healed, thanks to the power of an ancient talisman in their hand, which can revive the dead but exponentially increases their age with each resurrection. Vowing revenge on Yang and his accomplices, the child spends the next eight years living in isolation, training relentlessly and gathering information about his targets. \n","\n","As an adult, the sifu's child, now a skilled martial artist, begins their quest for revenge, tracking down and executing each of Yang's former accomplices after besting them in combat:\n","\n","Finally, the martial artist goes after Yang himself, confronting him at his private sanctuary.

Upon doing so, however, the martial artist sees two graves and learns that Yang tried to steal the talisman to save his dying wife and daughter, but was stopped from doing so by the sifu, who declared that Yang lost his worthiness by dishonoring his oath and expelled him from the school. The talisman then tells the martial artist of the importance of Wude (morality) and sends them back in time, to the beginning of their quest.

Elster is limited to six items on her person, including weapons, ammunition and key items for use in puzzle-solving and unlocking doors.

These scenery are a combination of 2D and 3D artwork, real-world photographs incorporated into the game, limited full-motion graphics, and short live-action sequences.[1][5][6][7] At some points in the game, quiz questions are shown for the player to answer, in addition to mini-games the player can complete.

The player controls an airplane along two axes while attacking enemies. The gameplay world is rendered in 3D, and at key points an in-game cutscene plays in which the camera and plane move. These are often transitions into another part of the gameplay world, but are also used to give the player a new perspective for things such as boss battles.[3] The plane's primary weapons can be upgraded, and players are equipped with a limited-use, more powerful secondary weapon to eliminate more on-screen enemies at one time.[4] Consecutive kills with the primary weapon will increase the game's score multiplier, while use of the secondary weapon or time manipulation will reset the multiplier. The player's final score is determined by a number of factors including kills, damage taken, and powerups collected.[4]\n","\n","As the game is marketed as a bullet hell shooter it features four difficulties: normal, challenging, hard and insane. The normal difficulty reduces the on-screen ordnance from enemies, while the insane difficulty is geared towards those who are veterans of the genre. In this difficulty the ordnance on the screen is much higher, forcing a greater difficulty level.[5] In addition, four game modes are included: Story, Arcade, Score Attack, and Boss Training. Story mode is the primary mode of the game and allows the player to see the narrative as the game progresses. On the standard difficulty players are given eight continues, while the Insane difficulty yields only five. Completing levels on the more challenging difficulty unlocks an alternate narrative.[4] Arcade mode removes the narrative cutscenes and limits the player to only three continues. Score Attack mode allows players to replay any stage previously completed with only one life. The objective is to achieve the highest score possible and complete the stage. Players do not progress to the next stage after completion in this mode. Boss Training allows players to practice and/or replay any unlocked boss battles. Continues in this mode are unlimited.[4]\n","\n","Sine Mora does not use a traditional player health mechanic. It instead plays on the aspect of time. Each level is given a set amount of time which continues to tick downwards. Taking damage will temporarily speed up this process, while eliminating enemies will add time back.[6] Powerups in the game can provide bonuses such as shielding, extra time, and upgraded weapon.[6] Players can choose from multiple characters and planes, and the combination of choices determines the vital statistics during play. Characters are not tied to a specific plane, rather characters and planes each have unique attributes, the combination of which determines the statistics.[6]\n","\n","\n","Gameplay[edit]\n","\n","The Sinking City is an open-world detective game with a third-person camera perspective.

The player can swim if necessary, but the water is infested and can fatally damage the player's health and sanity. The player also assembles an arsenal of tools and weapons, and at times must use them to kill otherworldly creatures and dispel hallucinations. However, as Oakmont is an isolated place with dwindling resources and deteriorating social order, bullets have replaced money as the preferred currency; expending too many bullets can leave the player unable to barter for desired items. Another major resource is sanity, which is spent on investigative powers used to reconstruct crime scenes and identify clues. Sanity slowly regenerates on its own, but can be replenished faster with antipsychotic drugs. Disturbing scenes and encounters can cause sudden, sharp drops in sanity, affecting the player's perception of the surrounding environment, and complete loss of sanity is fatal.[3][4]\n","\n","Plot[edit]\n","\n","The Sinking City takes place in the secluded city of Oakmont, Massachusetts in the 1920s, a place that is not marked on any map and few people know how to find due to its remoteness. Oakmont has a long history of association with the occult and many of its citizens are not only eccentric, but unabashed practitioners of occultism. Cultists in bloody ritual garb are an unremarkable sight on the streets alongside fishermen, average townsfolk, refugees from the destruction of nearby Innsmouth, the destitute and desperate and well-heeled members of the upper class. The town also developed its own unique dialect over the years, but the origin of many phrases is murky. Six months prior to the events of the game, Oakmont was inundated by a mysterious, persistent flood of supernatural origin that has submerged many of its streets and cut it off from the mainland. The Flood brought with it a dark force that inexorably instils hysteria and madness in the minds of the terrified citizens and the struggling city is on the brink of collapse. In addition, droves of people from outside Oakmont who were reported missing have been turning up in the town, drawn by haunting, unaccountable visions.[5][6][4]\n","\n","Charles Winfield Reed, a U.S. Navy sailor and World War I veteran turned private investigator, travels from Boston to Oakmont at the invitation of intellectual Johannes van der Berg to discover the cause of the nightmarish visions that have been plaguing him since the disappearance of the ship he served on, the USS Cyclops. These visions are shared by numerous other people and are reported most frequently in Oakmont. Reed is also hired by Robert Throgmorton, the influential and physically striking head of one of Oakmont's leading families who has also been studying the visions, to help uncover the cause of the Flood plaguing the town. While Reed pursues this investigation and others using extrasensory powers of observation seemingly bestowed by his visions, uncovering the shadowy history and seedy underbelly of Oakmont along the way, he must guard his sanity as it is eroded by the town's darkness, otherworldly creatures attracted to death called Wylebeasts and the use of his own powers.[3][7][4]\n","\n","Reed's search for answers ultimately unearths a plot by the Great Old Ones to purge humanity. Johannes van der Berg is revealed to be a guise used by Hastur, the King in Yellow, who lures potential Chosen to Oakmont in order to unseal the sunken temple of Cthygonnaar, which imprisons Cthylla, the secret daughter of Cthulhu and Idh-yaa as well as the source of the Flood, Wylebeasts and the nightmares. Once Cthylla is freed, she will give birth to Cthulhu's reincarnation, resulting in Oakmont drowning in the sea and the world being destroyed by the arrival of the other Great Old Ones.\n","\n","Reed is faced with a choice, leading to one of three endings:\n","\n","It is implied that the fruition of Cthulhu's plan is inevitable even in the former two endings, as Reed is seen either witnessing or hallucinating Johannes arriving in Boston and flooding it, or Johannes is seen on the Oakmont docks awaiting another boat with another prospective Chosen.\n","\n","\n","None\n","Gameplay[edit]\n","\n","The game plays similarly to the Tony Hawk's Pro Skater series of video games, except for the player controlling a small bird on a skateboard instead of a human.[1] Levels take place in a similar setting to the Micro Machines series of video games, with small-scaled \"bird-sized skateparks\" taking place across play areas of a house across real-life objects such as pencils, erasers, and other desktop type items.[2][3] Similar to Tony Hawk's Pro Skater games, gameplay is a mixture of performing skateboard tricks, exploration, and item collection.[2] Tricks are more simple to perform and lead to over-the-top tricks, unlike games like Skate, which focus on realism in trick performing.[2]\n","\n","\n","Gameplay[edit]\n","\n","The engine and playstyle for Skullgirls were modeled after Marvel vs. Capcom 2: New Age of Heroes, incorporating several similar game mechanics such as tag team-based combat, character assists, snapbacks, and delayed hyper combos.[1][2] The game can be played using different ratios of characters (similarly to Capcom vs. SNK 2: Mark of the Millennium 2001), with each player able to select up to three fighters on their team. The teams are then balanced based on the number of team members. A single character possesses more health and deals more damage, while larger teams gain the ability to perform character assists and recover health when tagged out.[2] Players can customize their character assist attacks.[3]\n","\n","The game includes a story mode, arcade mode, versus mode, training room, tutorial mode, and online play using the GGPO networking library.[2][4] Skullgirls includes various unique features to address system and balance problems, such as infinite combo detection.[5] When the game detects a looping combo through monitoring the players' attacks, the other player can break free of the infinite by hitting any button.[1] In addition, Skullgirls offers protection against \"unblockable attacks\", which occur when a player, for example, uses a low-hitting move and a high-hitting assist attack at the same time, making it nearly impossible for the opponent to block. The game attempts to remedy the issue by offering a brief period of unblockable protection after successfully blocking any attack.[1]\n","\n","Skullgirls Encore was released with numerous gameplay adjustments and additions, including character balance tweaks, faster gameplay, an online training mode, and a stun meter designed to limit lengthy combos without compromising creativity.[6][7] A new local game mode called \"Typing of the Skullgirls\", a mode inspired by games like The Typing of the Dead, was added.[8] When enabled, teams automatically generate meter and all attacks deal negligible damage.[8] Super moves give typing prompts to the player, awarding damage for typing accuracy.[8] In addition to fully voiced story modes and cross-platform play across the PlayStation family, Skullgirls 2nd Encore introduced challenges, where players fight against opponents under unique battle conditions; trials, which test players' skills by having them perform combos; and survival mode, which pits players against endless waves of enemies.[9] The mobile version of Skullgirls incorporates role-playing-like progression, customization, and deck-building mechanics.[10][11]\n","\n","\n","None\n","None\n","None\n","Gameplay[edit]\n","\n","In Skyforge, players assume the role of an immortal with incredible celestial powers who must protect the planet Aelion from invaders who threaten the world and its population.[6] Character progression within the game is not level based;[7] instead of a traditional leveling format, Skyforge features a 'prestige' system, which allows a player to advance based on the sum total of their stats and progression. This allows players to develop and switch between 17 different classes[8] at any time, rather than being locked into a class choice made earlier in the game. As a player gains more prestige, additional content, gear, and followers are unlocked.[9] Once the player becomes a god, Skyforge includes an additional progression system which allows users to manage their followers to increase their character's overall power.[10]\n","\n","Aelion has a lot of missions to take on and locations to visit. The capital of Aelion serves as the game's hub, with three core locations. The Divine Observatory is where the player can take on missions and visit different locations through a hologram globe.

At the beginning of the game, players can select a battle class (Knight, Smasher, Sentinel, Swashbuckler, Brawler, Sorcerer, Quickshot, Ninja, Bazooker, and Bowslinger) and elemental class (The ten elements of the Skylanders series), which determines their fighting style.[4] While the battle class cannot be reset within the game itself, unofficial methods exist to completely reset the Creation Crystal via the use of older Skylanders games on the Wii and Nintendo 3DS. Afterwards, players can customize the names, voices, fighting abilities, appearances, colors and sizes of their Imaginators. For players who do not wish to create a new character, they can use a mechanic that automatically generates an Imaginators randomly, or use any existing Skylanders featured in its predecessors. The Imaginators created can be shared to other players. Body parts, which are classified into four types, namely Common, Rare, Epic, and Ultimate, can be found when players are exploring in the game. These new parts can be used to customize the player's existing Imaginators, which can be modified at any time.[5] Creation Crystals are where the Imaginators are stored. With the crystal, players can transport their custom Imaginatiors to all video game consoles the game is released for. In addition to Imaginators, the game also adds 31 more typical Skylanders into the game. These new characters are called \"Senseis\", and they are extremely powerful, as they are extremely refined in their respective classes. 11 of these Senseis are villains who had appeared in previous Skylanders games. They also have the ability to perform a special attack called \"Sky Chi\".

This level has iconic gameplay features present in previous Crash Bandicoot games.[6]\n","\n","\n","None\n","Gameplay[edit]\n","\n","Slay the Spire is a combination of roguelike-inspired progression and the gameplay of a deck-building card game. At the start of a playthrough the player selects one of four predetermined characters,[a] which sets a starting amount of health, gold, a starting relic that provides a unique ability for that character, and an initial deck of cards with basic attack and defense cards as well what potential color-coded cards tailored to that character they will see through the run.[1] The goal is to work through several levels of a spire, each level having a number of potential encounters distributed in a branching structure with a boss character at the end of the level. Encounters include monsters which vary in strength; elite enemies which offer enhanced rewards; campfires to heal or upgrade cards to more powerful versions; shopkeepers to buy cards, relics and potions from, as well as to remove cards from the deck; chests with random loot; and random choice-based encounters.[2]\n","\n","Combat is played in turns. Each turn the player receives a fresh hand of cards and three energy points. The player can play any combination of cards as long as they have the energy to pay for the energy cost of each card, and at the end of the turn, all cards not played are sent to a discard pile. Players' cards vary by the character but generally consist of attack cards to damage opponents, skill cards that buff themselves, debuff opponents, or add to their blocking power for the turn, and power cards where the effect remains in play until the end of combat. Each opponent on the field will telegraph what move they will make: if they will attack and with how much damage, if they will block, cast a spell to buff themselves or debuff the player.[3] In some cases, the opponents' attack or the player cards may add unplayable cards representing battle conditions like Wounds and Curses to the player's deck that can dilute a player's hand and may add negative effects while in the player's hand.[4] The player can determine the best strategy to avoid taking any damage after they complete their turn. If the player's health drops to zero, the game is over and they must restart from the bottom of the spire. Otherwise, if the player defeats all the monsters in an encounter, they typically receive gold and a choice of one of three randomly-selected cards to add to their deck, if desired. Other loot that can be obtained from monsters or other encounters include relics that provide a permanent character buff for the duration of the game, such as increased maximum health, additional energy points, lower casting costs, and automatic blocking, and single-use potions that can be used during any turn for no cost to restore health, buff the player, and debuff or damage the enemy.[3]\n","\n","The deck-building game requires players to develop a strategy for their deck on the fly based on the cards they can obtain from loot and in synergy with the relics they obtain. Like other deck-building, too many weak cards or the unplayable cards dilute the player's deck, and the player must strategically decide which cards are the best fit to make the deck effective, when to turn down additions of cards, or when to spend money to remove cards as to maximize the deck's strength.[2][4][3][1]\n","\n","Slay the Spire features metagaming aspects. Completed or failed runs contribute points towards unlocking new characters or new relics and cards that will be made available for the specific character. Up to 20 Ascension difficulty levels unlock with each successfully completed run, each adding a cumulative negative effect such as lower health or stronger enemy attacks. Achievements provide several challenges to the player such as to climb the tower with a character using only their starting relic or with only common cards in their decks. A daily challenge gives players a single chance to get as high in the spire as they can under pre-set conditions and a fixed random seed, so that each player is starting from the same point and sees the same encounters.[5]\n","\n","\n","Gameplay[edit]\n","\n","The majority of the game takes place in abandoned areas (house, defunct mine, etc.), each with different objectives. Slender: The Arrival uses similar mechanics to its predecessor, The Eight Pages. The character is armed only with a flashlight. This limited defense forces a sense of helplessness, as the best way to survive in the game is to run whenever in danger. The Slender Man's behavior changes slightly between levels. In the first level, the Slender Man can be seen standing outside of the house through every window, once the player acquires the flashlight, and after going through the gate outside he can be seen on the top of hills well away from the player. In level two, he most often teleports off-screen or just out of the character's line of sight, but is capable of appearing directly in front of the player. It is observed that his motion centers around following the player, but consists largely of jumping from place to place, the inconvenience of which is increased as each of the eight pages are collected. His behavior is much the same as this in level four, except more active. In level three, he pursues much less aggressively, though is capable of teleporting directly in front of the player. In this level, the main antagonist is a girl who chases the player (most often following her path directly, but has been seen teleporting. It is unknown whether this is a glitch or an in-game mechanic). The only way of subduing her is by focusing the flashlight (on its second setting) on her. While looking at the Slender Man, the camera succumbs to electronic distortions such as static, blurring, color spots, audio distortion, etc., which obstructs the player's vision unless facing away, and far enough from it. The player cannot pause while this occurs, to prevent them taking a break due to being frightened. When caught, the game over screen is also different; while in Slender: The Eight Pages, the player saw a white static background with Slender Man's faceless head, the one for Slender: The Arrival is black, with an overhead-lit and color-distorted hue and less static.[1]\n","There are also new choices in difficulty (which must first be unlocked by completing the game once) being easy, normal, and hardcore. In hardcore, the flashlight can run out, enemies are more aggressive and the player's stamina runs out quickly. Easy has infinite flashlight, a great deal of stamina, and the enemies are not very aggressive.\n","\n","Plot[edit]\n","\n","Slender: The Arrival follows the story of two childhood friends, Lauren and Kate, after the events in Slender: The Eight Pages. Kate, who is the protagonist of the Eight Pages, is selling her childhood home.\n","\n","Lauren, in response to a call from Kate, comes to help sell and move Kate out of her old home, bringing a video camera with her. The road to Kate's house is blocked by a fallen tree, forcing Lauren to leave her car behind and walk there. Along the way, she passes another car (who the car belongs to is unknown). With the sun setting, Lauren discovers Kate's home, doors ajar, furniture and belongings disheveled. She also finds a flashlight and a key to Kate's room. On the walls of Kate's room are black scratchings of an ominous figure and messages. Lauren hears a woman's scream coming from outside and investigates the sound, heading into the wooded park behind the house. She activates three generators to light up the path and finds a burnt farmhouse. Inside is Charlie Matheson Jr., a boy who had disappeared years ago and is now deformed. He disappears when Lauren approaches him.\n","\n","Lauren searches the wooded area for clues as to the whereabouts of her friend but only finds more scribbled drawings. As she ventures deeper into the park, she encounters a tall, faceless figure named Slender Man, who can only be seen through video cameras. After all eight pages are collected, Lauren runs from Slender Man, slipping down an embankment, hitting her head and passing out.\n","\n","She regains consciousness in the morning, and still searching for Kate, Lauren stumbles upon an old abandoned coal mine. To get out, she attempts to power the emergency lift by activating six generators. Her progress is hindered by the attack of a figure known as the Chaser, who seems to have photophobia, can be hindered by Lauren's flashlight. Slender Man also attempts to attack Lauren in the mine.\n","\n","Lauren powers and uses the lift to escape the mine. She reaches a storage outpost with a television and two tapes. One shows Kate (who has a video camera of her own) hurriedly scribbling upon papers before discovering that Slender Man is trying to get in, she starts to close every door and window in the house, but Slender Man manages to get inside. Kate then runs back to her room where Slender Man suddenly appears and she proceeds to jump out of the bedroom window before the tape abruptly ends. The other tape shows Carl-Ross (or CR for short), a friend of Kate, investigating a farm where he collects evidence into the story of Charles Matheson. Like Lauren and Kate, he also has a video camera. He uses gas canisters to power a generator, and looks for a key to unlock a gate to the Matheson family chapel. Charlie, now a deformed and zombie-like follower of Slenderman, pursues him and eventually chases him away. \n","\n","Lauren continues up the mountainside towards a radio tower and along the way, she can find a teddy bear. Interacting with it starts an optional level where Charlie is playing on the beach with his parents at a picnic out of reach. After being led away by collecting a trail of toy trains that lead him into the woods, he is caught by Slender Man. Continuing onward to the radio tower, Lauren finds herself emerging from a mine into a forest fire, where Slenderman aggressively pursues her.\n","\n","Lauren escapes her attacker after getting inside the radio tower building and looks for a key to unlock a door. Her flashlight's batteries die as she goes through the door, only to find she has reached a dead end, containing a burnt body (who is possibly CR), a fire, and a camera with the recording of two panicked people, Kate and CR. Shortly after listening, the corridor goes dark and Charlie runs towards Lauren and she blacks out.\n","\n","An additional level takes place after Kate fled into the woods where she collected the eight pages while being followed by Slender Man, after finding all the pages Slender Man catches her, claiming that he \"has plans for her\".\n","\n","If the player has beaten the game once before, a Hardcore difficulty option will unlock, which is like the first game but more difficult. One difference is that Lauren must find gas canisters in order to power the generators in the mine. Before a game update, upon completion of the game again, Lauren will attempt to escape by jumping from a high area, in which her camera dies after she does so. After an update to the game, this ending is no longer possible to get. The game now ends with Lauren awake in the basement of the farmhouse from earlier with Charlie blocking the way out. After finding two documents, Charlie disappears. Lauren hears crying upstairs and finds Kate, but Kate turns into the Chaser (implying that they are the same person) and attacks her. Lauren's camera turns back on temporarily to show someone's legs (most likely Lauren's) being dragged away by someone unseen, who is presumably either Kate, Charlie, or Slender Man.\n","\n","A secret level is also unlockable, which takes place at Kate's house in the daytime. The player's character is unknown but the goal of the level is basically a hide and seek from Slender Man.\n","\n","\n","Gameplay[edit]\n","\n","Smite features many different game modes with the largest being Conquest.[8] Players can choose between Training (vs AI), Custom, Co-Op (with clan/friends), Normal and Ranked play styles. From there, they can choose between a variety of standard game modes. Special event games with unique rules like unlimited gold are also often introduced.\n","\n","With every game, players have to choose a god or other figure to play as. Currently, players can choose between a large variety of characters from different pantheons including, but not limited to, Babylonian, Celtic, Chinese, Egyptian, Greek, Hindu, Japanese, Norse, Polynesian, Slavic and Yoruba. The characters of King Arthur's legends (referred to as the Arthurian pantheon in-game) and the Cthulhu Mythos (referred to as the pantheon of the Great Old Ones) are also considered pantheons in this video game.[9]\n","\n","Each character is classified as one of the following classes: Assassin, Guardian, Hunter, Mage, or Warrior. Unless otherwise stated, two players on the same team cannot choose the same character (in competitive modes and those using a Draft pick method, each player must use a different character).[9] Successful team configurations are typically based on standard RPG raid configurations (tank, healer, physical/magical damage) during god selection.\n","\n","The player controls the god in a third-person perspective which is a unique characteristic of this MOBA, as other games of this genre are typically played from a top-down perspective. Each god has a basic attack, a passive trait and four abilities with varying effects, such as area damage, crowd control, buffs and many more. These abilities are acquired and upgraded when the player's character levels up by gaining experience from being in range of minions when they are killed, taking down towers or phoenixes and defeating enemy characters. The maximum level is 20 and each successive level is more difficult to reach. Gold (used to buy items that increase power, defense and passive effects, potions, wards and abilities) is accumulated through standard periodic income, by slaying enemies (player and NPC alike) or selling owned items.\n","\n","The large areas between the lanes make up what is called the \"jungle\", where computer-controlled monsters such as packs of cyclopes or Furies (the latter alternately referred to as harpies) periodically spawn at specific locations distributed symmetrically across the map. Killing certain monsters in said jungle causes a \"buff\" to drop on the ground where it can be picked up by a player, which depending on the type of monster killed will grant the player bonuses to stats such as damage dealt, movement speed, attack speed. There are three special neutral monsters who appear less frequently that when killed will grant the entire team who killed it a powerful damage buff for a medium length of time, set amount of Gold, and a speed boost when coming out of the base respectively. There are also some monsters which do not offer a buff, only experience and gold.[10]\n","\n","\n","None\n","Gameplay[edit]\n","\n","Snake Pass is a 3D puzzle-platform game where players play as a coral snake named Noodle with his bird sidekick named Doodle. The game has 15 levels across four themed worlds. It takes place in the fictional jungle setting of Haven Tor. The first world is themed around the jungle, the second around water, the third around lava, and the fourth around winds. Each world contains four levels, except for the final world which contains three. In each world the goal is to collect three colored gemstones called Keystones in order to reopen a portal to finish the level. In addition to the Keystones, there are 2 additional optional collectible types: Blue Whisps and gold Gatekeeper Coins. There are 20 Blue Whisps in each level, which are scattered along the critical path of the level, and five Gatekeeper Coins, which are put in more difficult-to-reach places.[1]\n","\n","The game's controls are based on snake locomotion. The player can move Noodle's head 360 degrees on a flat plane, lift it up, move Noodle forward, tighten his grip, and call Doodle to lift Noodle's tail. Moving forward in a straight line is slow, so Noodle must slither from side to side in order to gain speed. The game considers Noodle's body to be made up of many small segments, each of which is affected by physics, and so Noodle's body reacts naturally to gravity. The player must wrap Noodle's body around objects in order to stay secure and not fall, as well as to climb structures.[2] Different worlds introduce different mechanics; in addition to bamboo structures that Noodle can wrap around to secure himself, levels can also feature bodies of water where Noodle can freely swim and dive, wind currents that can blow Noodle around, and hazards like spikes and lava pits. If Noodle is killed by a hazard or bottomless pit, he respawns at the last checkpoint, and any collectibles he obtained after passing it are returned to their original locations.[3]\n","\n","After each level is beaten, players unlock a time trial mode for speedrunning the game. After beating the game, the player will unlock Snake Vision, a new power where the player can see all the remaining collectibles in a level while Noodle remains idle, and an arcade mode for each level in which Doodle collect fruit for points under a time limit.[4]\n","\n","Plot[edit]\n","\n","Doodle finds that a mysterious intruder is stealing the Keystones that allow travel in the gates between the lands. She wakes Noodle and together they set off to find the intruder, traveling to the top of Haven Tor along the way. In each of the worlds they see big black feathers and a large flying figure along the way. At the end of each world, the ruler of that realm thanks Noodle and Doodle and gives them a treasure. At the end of the final realm, they see that the magpie was looking for something shiny in order to reopen a portal to take them home. In approaching the bird, the 4 gifts given to Noodle and Doodle from the ruler of each realm work as keys and reveal \"the Great Shiny.\" It then activates the portal, which allows the bird to go home. However, it soon returns, asking for the duo's help.\n","\n","\n","Gameplay[edit]\n","\n","The game retains and builds on the mechanics of Sniper Elite V2. Players go through large sandbox-style battlefield maps based on locations from the North African theater of World War II.\n","\n","The sniper rifle is the player's primary weapon, though additional weapons, including submachine guns and pistols (silenced or not depending on the situation) are available. In addition to hand grenades, the player can deploy tripwire booby traps, two different types of land mines, and dynamite. Binoculars can be used to tag enemies, displaying their position and movements. Small fires can be set to distract enemies or detonate explosives. The player-character can hold their breath while aiming to properly line up a shot. A red icon appears in the scope, marking the projected point of impact. There are weapon parts spread out all over the game or found when looting dead enemies, allowing players to customize their weapons in the pre-deployment menu; the menu also allows equipment loadouts.\n","\n","Stealth mechanics have been reworked. An eye icon squints or opens to denote the player's level of detection by the enemy. Enemy soldiers will also have a circle meter over their heads to indicate alert status. Players are also forced to relocate periodically to prevent detection with a white ghost image to mark their last known position if spotted; enemy soldiers will search the surrounding area either individually or in groups. As in the previous game, loud sounds may be used to mask sniper shots, however, the player now has the option to sabotage generators as a means of creating noise.\n","\n","A points system is instituted for actions such as stealth close-combat or using traps to kill enemies, with the points accumulating towards promotion to higher ranks. Players can go around the map to collect special reward items such as collectors' cards and unlock \"sniper nests\" built into the environment. Journal pages also provide further backstory into the events of the game.\n","\n","V2's X-Ray kill cam system is retained as well. Where the previous game only allowed the player to see the body's internal structure at point of impact, the new game expands to visualize the rest of the cardiovascular, skeletal, and muscular systems. The player can still target vehicles, but now has a chance to shoot the engines and disable the vehicle, making it easier to destroy.\n","\n","Plot[edit]\n","\n","In June 1942, during the Battle of Gazala, American sniper Karl Fairburne (Tom Clarke-Hill) takes part in an effort by British troops to stop Erwin Rommel and the Afrika Korps from seizing the vital port city of Tobruk. Fairburne eliminates several German artillery positions, but the enemy takes the city and he is forced to abandon his fellow soldiers. Nevertheless, his performance in the battle brings him to the attention of British Naval Intelligence, who recruit him to hunt down General Franz Vahlen, a favorite of Hitler's who is rumored to be working on a top-secret weapon. \n","\n","Fairburne heads to the Gaberoun oasis in Libya, assassinating several German and Italian officers at a supply and logistics outpost while searching for intel on Vahlen. He only finds a document revealing the name of Vahlen's project: \"Project Seuche\" (German for \"plague\"). Naval Intelligence then asks Fairburne to rescue one of their agents, who was captured while gathering information on Vahlen's work. The informant is being held at Fort Rifugio, a POW camp formerly occupied by the British during Operation Compass. The Long Range Desert Group agrees to transport Fairburne in exchange for his help in capturing the German-held Halfaya Pass; Fairburne infiltrates the enemy camp and destroys several Flak 88s.\n","\n","Fairburne successfully infiltrates Fort Rifugio and frees the informant, Brauer. He gives Fairburne the location of Vahlen's command, a desert village at the Siwa Oasis in Western Egypt. Fairburne, now referred to as the Wüstengeist (Desert Ghost) by the Germans for his exploits, sneaks into the town and finds out that Vahlen's discontented officers plan to betray him, having stolen his personal notebook which reveals his plan to get rid of Rommel. Fairburne kills the officer tasked to take the notebook to Berlin and escapes with Brauer's help. He discovers that Vahlen, hungry for glory and fame, intends to use his new weapon to destroy the Allies in North Africa and then go on to conquer all of Europe.\n","\n","Fairburne and Brauer locate Vahlen's secret field HQ near the Kasserine Pass and open the general's personal safe, which contains a film reel that reveals \"Project Seuche\" is a supertank codenamed Ratte. Brauer is subsequently killed by a round from a Tiger I before Fairburne is able to destroy it. He buries Brauer, taking a bullet from his gun. As the Africa Korps begin to lose ground to the Allies, Fairburne joins the LRDG in assaulting the German-controlled Pont du Fahs Airfield, cutting off Vahlen's last supply line and finding a map leading to the Ratte production facility, which is nestled inside the Midès canyon. Fairburne enters the factory, sabotages its electrical supply and plants explosive charges to destroy the Ratte prototype, before detonating a massive pile of ammunition to level the complex. Vahlen is trapped by debris while fleeing the crumbling factory; Fairburne takes his Luger, loads it with Brauer's bullet, and shoots him in the head before escaping.\n","\n","A voiceover by Fairburne during the end credits reveals that the intelligence he acquired on the Ratte prompted the USAAF and the RAF to launch  Operation Chastise and the Battle of the Ruhr, resulting in extensive damage to German heavy industry and forcing the German high command to cancel efforts to build more Ratte tanks.\n","\n","\n","Gameplay[edit]\n","\n","Sniper Elite 4 is a tactical shooter game with stealth elements, played from a third-person perspective. When the player kills an enemy using a sniper rifle from a long distance, the X-Ray kill cam system will activate, in which the game's camera follows the bullet from the sniper rifle to the target, and shows body parts, bones or internal body organs being broken or ruptured by the bullet.[1] The system has also been expanded to include shrapnel kills, melee kills and stealth kills.[2]\n","\n","The game's artificial intelligence is improved, with enemies being able to react to the player's action more responsively. When an enemy is killed, other enemies will begin actively looking for them.[3] The player is equipped with a pair of binoculars, which shows the player where the enemies are and what weapons they are carrying, as well as the ability to tag opponents and objects. The game features the \"officers\" rank. Killing the officer as early as possible will lead his army to retreat, while killing him by the end of a mission will significantly increase the level's difficulty.[3] The player can place traps and use corpses as booby traps.[4] The game also features night missions, in which the player can remove light sources to hide their presence.[1][3]\n","\n","Maps in the game are significantly larger than Sniper Elite III, granting players more freedom and open-ended gameplay.[2] The maps also feature more verticality. The game's new movement system allows Fairburne to climb and grab ledges.[5] Cooperative missions and competitive multiplayer modes are reintroduced.[6]\n","\n","Plot[edit]\n","\n","Sniper Elite 4 is set in Italy in 1943, in the immediate aftermath of the events in Sniper Elite III. Upon learning about rumours of a new Nazi weapon, the Royal Navy sends a freighter, the Orchidea, to the island of San Celini to investigate. The ship is quickly sunk by the new weapon – a radio guided anti-ship missile under the development of scientist Andreas Kessler and Heinz Böhm, a high ranking Nazi general that the Allies have little information about. SOE sniper Karl Fairburne (Tom Clarke-Hill) is sent to the island after the sinking and tasked with assassinating General Tobias Schmidt along with several other officers who oversaw the attack, filming it to use as propaganda. After eliminating Schmidt, Fairburne is sent to the village of Bitanti by OSS agent Jack Weaver to find Sofia \"Angel\" Di Rocco, leader of the local Partisan resistance group. Distrustful of the OSS who allowed her father to be kidnapped by the Nazis, Angel enlists Fairburne to destroy a railway gun at Regelino Viaduct in order to prove himself and convince the group to join forces. After blowing up the viaduct and destroying the gun, Fairburne is sent to investigate a dockyard that the Nazis are using to ship the weapon part out of and call in a bombing raid to destroy the facility.\n","\n","Upon learning the Sicilian Mafia were helping disrupt operations at the dockyard to slow down the shipment of the weapon parts, Fairburne meets with kingpin Salvatore Dinelli who agrees to provide additional assistance after eliminating Piero Capo, leader of the local Black Brigade. Distrustful of the Mafia's intentions, the Partisans are reluctant to maintain the alliance. However when an SOE informant, Major Hans Dorfmann, reveals that Kessler is at the Magazzeno Facility where the missiles are assembled, Fairburne infiltrates the base to kidnap Kessler and steal his research notes. On interrogation, Kessler tells Angel her father is still alive, prompting the Partisans to depart to assault the town of Giovi Fiorini and find Böhm's confidant Major Klaus Rothbauer. Kessler then tells Fairburne that he is dying of liver cancer due to his heavy drinking and is of no use to the Nazis or the Allies as a result, and that the information given to Angel was a lie in order to lure the Partisans into a trap. Fairburne departs to Giovi Fiorini and eliminates Rothbauer, but the ensuing battle results in the Partisans being massacred.\n","\n","Gathered intelligence allows the SOE to discover Böhm is aware of Operation Avalanche and has the constructed missiles sent to his fortress at Allagra, intending to both inflict enough damage on the fleet to prevent the invasion of Italy from being a success and attempting to kill General Dwight Eisenhower. Fairburne infiltrates the base, disabling each of the missiles. As he attempts to call in a bombing raid on the facility, Dorfmann appears with a captured Angel, revealing himself to be Böhm. Böhm executes Angel and quickly departs to his plane, intending to take off and personally carry out the attack on Eisenhower's ship. Fairburne gives chase and succeeds in shooting out the plane's engines before it can take off, destroying the plane and killing Böhm just as the Allied Lancaster bombers arrive to destroy the base. In the epilogue scene, Jack offers Karl a job in the OSS and Karl says he will think about it.\n","\n","\n","Gameplay[edit]\n","\n","Sniper Elite V2 is a third-person tactical shooter that emphasizes a less direct approach to combat, encouraging the player to use stealth and keep their distance from enemy soldiers. Most of the single player campaign missions provide multiple routes for the player to take, including multi-story buildings and side streets, to get vantage points and to hide from pursuing enemies. Set in World War II, the player character utilises appropriate weapons for the era. The sniper rifle is the primary weapon throughout the game, with a variety of submachine guns and pistols available as side arms. In addition to hand grenades, the player can deploy tripwire booby traps, anti-infantry land mines, and dynamite. Binoculars can be used to tag enemies in view, displaying their position and movements to the player. When using the sniper rifle, certain elements can determine the outcome of a shot, taking realistic ballistics into consideration such as wind direction and strength and bullet drop potentially altering the shot through the scope.[7]  Bullets can ricochet off surfaces or targets and strike others. Different postures, including crouching or lying down on the front, can also steady a shot, and the player character also has the ability to take a deep breath which from their perspective appears to slow down time. Another key ability is that when the player character is spotted, their last movements and position to the enemy is shown as a white-outlined figure, potentially allowing the player to escape that area while enemy soldiers fire at the wrong target.[8]\n","\n","A major feature of V2 is the \"X-Ray Kill Cam\" where a successful and skilled shot will be followed in slow motion from the bullet shooting out of the sniper rifle to the target where upon impact the player will be shown an anatomically correct X-ray style reveal of the body part being hit and the damage the bullet causes to the target's organs and bones. Sniping can also be used to shoot the enemies' own grenades, killing them and anyone nearby. This method can also be used against military vehicles by targeting fuel tanks and valves, and can even detonate fuel canisters and artillery shells marked with red paint. The game will also measure notable shots by briefly displaying distance and other factors like whether it was a head shot or moving target.[7]\n","\n","Plot[edit]\n","\n","The protagonist is U.S. Army Second Lieutenant Karl Fairburne (Tom Clarke-Hill), a German-American OSS operative and skilled sniper who is inserted into Berlin in 1945, during the final days of World War II. The game starts with Fairburne discussing Operation Paperclip and its predecessor, Operation Overcast, as the United States makes an effort to recruit the top scientific personnel of Nazi Germany with offers of employment. Fairburne is tasked with tracking down key individuals involved with the development of the V-2, which pits him against both the fanatical German forces defending Berlin and the invading Soviet forces who are eager to recruit the scientists to their side.\n","\n","The campaign's first mission has Fairburne assassinating German Major-General Hans von Eisenberg as he meets with a Soviet agent to defect to Russia. He escapes, and is given a new target: Dr. Gunther Kreidl, an expert in rocket engines who is being escorted out of the city in a military convoy. After laying an ambush, Fairburne eliminates Kreidl and obtains documents revealing the location of Germany's primary V-2 production facility, where Kreidl's three colleagues are hiding. Fairburne infiltrates the facility and destroys it with C-3, but finds no trace of the scientists. He manages to overhear a radio message revealing that one of his targets, Dr. Efram Schwaiger, has been caught trying to defect to the Americans.\n","\n","American intelligence informs Fairburne that Schwaiger has been taken to a detainment camp at the Opernplatz. To distract the Germans, Fairburne provokes the Soviets into attacking German defensive positions at an abandoned museum knowing that reinforcements will be sent to defend them. He then locates the camp, shoots a German officer before he can execute Schwaiger, and covers the scientist as he flees to safety before holding off Soviet troops sent to capture him. Schwaiger is mortally wounded in the crossfire and with his dying words states that \"Wolff has a plan\" involving \"Tabun\". Not knowing what to make of this information, Fairburne proceeds with a mission to assassinate his fourth target, Colonel Müller. After surviving a large German ambush while recovering his equipment, Fairburne infiltrates a flak tower and kills Müller with a long-distance shot.\n","\n","To find his last target, Dr. Wolff, Fairburne raids a Soviet field HQ. He obtains intel revealing that \"Tabun\" is actually a nerve gas developed by German scientists, which Wolff and the Soviets intend to load onto V-2 rockets aimed at London. With no idea where the launch will take place, Fairburne goes to Wolff's private office near the German war ministry to look for clues. He finds a notebook revealing Wolff's plan to escape on a Soviet airplane and a tattered map detailing all V-2 storage facilities and launch sites. Arriving just as the Soviets are fueling one of the rockets for the attack, Fairburne destroys it by detonating its fuel supply. He then fights his way back to the Brandenburg Gate, where he had assassinated von Eisenberg only a few days earlier, and where Wolff is about to escape with a Soviet escort to the airfield. With a single shot, he kills Wolff as the doctor speeds away, causing his car to swerve and flip over. As the Battle of Berlin comes to an end, Fairburne notes that the war may be over, but a new conflict is just beginning, and that his actions have made him its first soldier.\n","\n","\n","Gameplay[edit]\n","\n","Snipperclips is a co-operative puzzle game for up to four players.

Every location is a rural region in either North America or Russia. As the player progresses by doing certain missions, they earn money which can be spent on either upgrades for their current vehicles or better vehicles altogether.

The game features three playable characters: two variants of Sonic the Hedgehog (\"Classic\" and \"Modern\") and the \"Avatar\" (the player's custom character).[1] Each has unique abilities and attributes: Classic Sonic is restricted to side-scrolling gameplay reminiscent of the Sega Genesis Sonic games and can perform a spin dash on the ground and a drop dash in mid-air to gain speed.[2] Modern Sonic's gameplay follows a similar style to Sonic Unleashed and Sonic Colors: he can double jump, perform a homing attack on enemies, springs, and grappling hooks, and a speed boost by collecting White Wisps.[3] The Avatar is created from a base of seven animal types, which each possess a unique ability; they also wield a grappling hook and can equip weapons known as Wispons, including flamethrowers, whips, and hammers. Depending on the Wispon, Avatars can use temporary abilities by collecting a corresponding Wisp type.[4][5] Certain parts see players controlling both Modern Sonic and the Avatar, switching between them as necessary, similar to Sonic Heroes.[6]\n","\n","The game is split into several themed levels, some of which are based on locations from past games, such as Green Hill Zone.[7] Players must complete each level while fighting waves of enemies, and (with the exception of Classic Sonic) seamlessly shift from side-scrolling to third-person perspectives.[8] Stages are filled with features such as spring boards, rails, and boost pads, and obstacles such as spikes, bottomless pits, and robots. Scattered around levels are golden rings, which serve as a form of health: rings protect players from damage caused by robots or other hazards, though they lose their rings upon being hit; being hit with no rings kills the player. The game does not use a traditional life system, instead deducting from the player's score depending on the number of deaths.[9] Players are given a grade dependent on their performance; an \"S\" rank is the best and a \"C\" is the worst.[10] Certain levels feature a boss, which must be defeated in order to proceed.[3] Bonus levels can be unlocked by collecting Red Rings hidden in most stages and players may occasionally receive SOS Missions, tasking them with replaying levels with a specific objective.[11]\n","\n","Plot[edit]\n","\n","Doctor Eggman attacks a city and Sonic sets out to stop him. Upon arriving, he is attacked by Infinite, a mercenary transformed by the power of the Phantom Ruby.[c] Infinite defeats Sonic and he is taken prisoner aboard the Death Egg. Without Sonic, the world is left without a defender, and Eggman, with the help of his robots, Infinite, Shadow the Hedgehog, Chaos, Zavok, and Metal Sonic, manages to conquer it within six months. Knuckles the Echidna forms a resistance movement with Tails, the Chaotix, Amy Rose, Silver the Hedgehog, Rouge the Bat, and a survivor of Eggman's attack whom they nickname the Rookie. Knuckles discovers Sonic's whereabouts and the Rookie steals a space shuttle, breaks into the Death Egg, and rescues Sonic. Back in the city, Tails is attacked by Chaos, but is saved by Classic Sonic (who was sent through a wormhole following the events of Sonic Mania). The two set out to spy on Eggman, learning of the Phantom Ruby and that Eggman has a plan to dispose of the resistance which will take effect in three days.\n","\n","Meanwhile, Sonic encounters Shadow, who reveals that the Shadow following Eggman is an illusionary clone created by the Phantom Ruby, as are the other villains serving him and that limitless numbers of them can be made. Tails infiltrates Eggman's computer network and finds the Phantom Ruby's weakness: the gemstone is directly powered by the Death Egg and will be rendered useless without it. While the Rookie stages a diversion, the Death Egg is destroyed by Classic Sonic. Believing they have the upper hand, the resistance attacks the Eggman Empire's capital, Metropolis. However, Eggman has a backup power source hidden in his empire's fortress, and as the resistance make their final charge toward it, he has Infinite enact his plan; creating an asteroid-like second sun over the planet that will eliminate the resistance with its impact. Thinking fast, the Rookie uses a prototype Phantom Ruby they had recovered to dispel the sun, saving everybody. Sonic and the Rookie then battle Infinite and defeat him. Eggman unveils yet another backup plan, moving the Phantom Ruby into a battle mech and fighting the resistance directly. Working together, the Sonics and the Rookie defeat Eggman, leaving the doctor’s whereabouts unknown. With the Phantom Ruby neutralized, all the clones serving Eggman's army vanish, Classic Sonic returns home, the Resistance disbands, and Modern Sonic and his friends set out to restore the world to its former glory while the Rookie leaves to find their own way.\n","\n","\n","Gameplay\n","\n","Sonic Frontiers is a 3D platformer and action-adventure game.[1][2] As Sonic, the player explores the Starfall Islands (which consist of various biomes including flowery fields, forests, ancient ruins, and deserts) to collect the Chaos Emeralds and investigate the islands' relationship to them.[3][1][4] Sonic retains his abilities from previous Sonic the Hedgehog games: he runs at high speeds, collects rings, grinds on rails,[5][6] and homes in on enemies to attack.[3] The player can double jump, sidestep, drop dash, and boost if they have enough energy.[7] New abilities include combat attacks, running alongside walls, and using the Cyloop to create a circle of light around objects and interact with them.[3][8] The Cyloop can perform different tasks by drawing certain shapes — for example, drawing an infinity symbol or an 8 will allow Sonic to boost indefinitely for a short time.[9] Sonic also gains the ability to temporarily boost indefinitely upon collecting the maximum number of rings.[10]  The player can customize the controls and adjust Sonic's speed, turning, acceleration and sensitivity, among other things. As they progress, they can also upgrade Sonic's speed, attack, defense and ring capacity.[7]\n","\n","The Starfall Islands act as the series's first open world,[4] which writers compared to The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild.[b] The world retains traditional Sonic elements, such as springs, boost pads, and grind rails.[15][16] The player explores the islands as they scale towers in platforming challenges to reveal parts of the map[7][15] and solve puzzles, such as orienting statues and speedrunning, to obtain items.[3][17] One of Sonic's objectives is to rescue three of his friends — Miles \"Tails\" Prower, Amy Rose, and Knuckles the Echidna — who are trapped in Cyber Space. Tails and Amy initially accompany Sonic in his investigation,[3][7] while Knuckles was transported there earlier from the ruins above Angel Island.[18]  This is accomplished by obtaining various collectibles found in the open world. Collectibles include Kocos, which upgrade Sonic's moveset, and Memory Tokens, which are used to trigger cutscenes and conversations with Sonic's friends when they receive them. These either progress the story's plot (occasionally via minigames) or expand their relationships with Sonic by requesting the player to complete side quests. Sonic's friends project themselves as holograms in the real world while trapped, allowing them to interact with and advise Sonic.[7]\n","\n","The player battles robots throughout the islands, all in various forms;[19] Sonic can dodge and parry attacks and use the Cyloop to make enemies easier to strike. Defeating enemies grants the player experience points that allow the player to purchase additional moves and abilities in combat and the open world. Alongside regular, small enemies, the player battles large \"Guardian\" bosses. Defeating a Guardian rewards the player with portal gears that, when placed in a portal, allow them to enter Cyber Space.[20]\n","\n","Each of the 30 Cyber Space levels, which shift between third-person and side-scrolling perspectives,[21] contains three optional objectives, including time attack, collecting rings, and collecting five red rings; completing each objective rewards players with a key required to collect a Chaos Emerald.[3] Big the Cat makes an appearance as a host for a fishing minigame[22] which is included in set areas of the maps, where Sonic can exchange purple coins found in the overworld to catch fish and other objects that net him fishing tokens based on catch quality. The tokens can then be redeemed for items and collectibles.[22] Collecting all seven Chaos Emeralds allows the player to transform into Super Sonic, which is required to battle and defeat the game's major bosses, the Titans.[23]\n","\n","Plot\n","\n","Doctor Eggman travels to the abandoned Starfall Islands to steal the technological secrets created by the Ancients, creatures related to Chaos.[24][25] When he uploads his artificial intelligence unit, Sage, into a portal, several robotic defense units are summoned. Detecting a threat signature, Sage ceases hijacking the portal and initiates a protection protocol, dragging Eggman into an artificial dimension called Cyber Space.\n","\n","Sonic, Tails and Amy investigate activity that has drawn the Chaos Emeralds to the islands, but their plane is sucked into a wormhole to Cyber Space. Sonic escapes to the islands in the real world, where a disembodied voice tasks him with finding the emeralds and destroying the island's robotic Titans to remove the boundary between the real and digital worlds. Believing this will save his friends – including Knuckles, who had been transported there while exploring the ruins above Angel Island – Sonic releases their digital forms from cages created by Sage, who works to free Eggman from Cyber Space; destroying the cages causes Sonic's body to become increasingly corrupted. Sage cautions Sonic to leave, influencing the islands' mechanical guardians and Titans to attack him, but grows to sympathize with him while observing his interactions with his friends, and forms a mutual bond with Eggman.\n","\n","Sonic and his friends learn about the history of the Ancients, who are revealed to be an extraterrestrial race whose planet was destroyed by The End, an all-powerful entity. The Ancients used the Chaos Emeralds to escape and were drawn to the Master Emerald on Earth, but The End followed and started to wipe out their new civilization. The Ancients built the Titans to seal it within Cyber Space, with their essences remaining within their accessories, the Koco, which become inert once Sonic and his friends help them fulfill their final desires in life.\n","\n","After destroying three of the Titans and disabling the towers that maintain the spatial boundary, Sonic succumbs to his corruption and is trapped between dimensions. Released along with his friends and Eggman, Sonic's guide reveals itself to be The End, which attacks Earth using the last Titan, Supreme. Sonic's friends purge the corruption from him by sacrificing their physical forms, while a reluctant Eggman and Sage help him collect the scattered Chaos Emeralds, which he uses to defeat Supreme. When The End flees into space, Sage takes control of the Titan and assists Sonic in confronting The End's true form, sacrificing herself to destroy it. Sonic's friends are restored and leave the islands with him, now wishing to make a difference in their lives after their new experience, while Eggman remains behind and revives Sage using the island's technology.\n","\n","\n","Gameplay[edit]\n","\n","Sonic Mania is a side-scrolling platformer similar to the early Sonic the Hedgehog games released for the Sega Genesis.

A fast-travel system allows the character to be moved between unlocked travel points.[3]\n","\n","The game allows the player to select one of ten archetypal superhero player-characters; the nimble Speedster, the short-range, high damage Brutalist, the long range, moderate damage Blaster, the weather-based Elementalist, the offense-attracting Cyborg, the long-range, status effecting Psychic, the stealthy Assassin, the gadget-using Gadgeteer, the healing Plantmancer, and the high-damage, swift Martial Artist.[4] At first only three choices are available (Blaster, Speedster, and Brutalist);[5][6] the New Kid can eventually access all ten classes, freely matching powers from the available classes,[6] for example, the player can use the Blaster's fire blasts, the Assassin's knives, and the Martial Artist's kicks.[7] The player can assign four powers from the classes, three regular attacks and one ultimate attack.[8] Ultimate attacks can only be used after filling the Ultimate bar, a pool of points shared between the New Kid and their allies that is increased by completing timed button presses during attacking and defending phases.[9][8] Throughout the game, the player can select up to three allies from twelve characters to accompany them in battle, each possessing three powers and an ultimate attack.[3][10]\n","\n","The Fractured but Whole retains the turn-based combat of the previous game in the series, South Park: The Stick of Truth (2014). Instead of taking place on a static plane, battles are fought on a variable-size grid on which the player and enemies can move freely to create strategic advantages.[11][12] The grid can contain environmental hazards such as exploding chemical barrels, and lava (red Lego bricks).[13] The player selects attacks from a menu.[14] Attacks can be augmented with contextual button presses for extra damage.[15] Timed button presses during enemy attacks can recover some health after being hit[3] and increase the Ultimate meter. Attacks offer effects including abilities with \"knockback\" damage, which can be used to forcibly move an opponent around the battlefield[12] and inflict status effects such as poisoning, freezing, burning, and bleeding, which inflict damage over time.[3][5][10]\n","\n","Each attack affects a different area of the grid, requiring strategic positioning to hit enemies and avoid attacks.[10] The attacker can increase damage by knocking targets into each other or into an ally.[5] Healing items can be used in battle, requiring one turn per use.[5] The player can collect artifacts and equipment to boost the player's Might, making them stronger in battle and offering benefits such as increased defense;[16] more artifacts can be used as the player's level increases. The player-character has a DNA slot, allowing them to use strands of DNA to boost attributes called Brawn, Brains, Health, Spunk, and Move.[17] The non-player character, PC Principal, can teach the player to recognize microaggressions in enemy dialogue, which allows the player a free in-battle attack against an enemy.[7] Some characters, such as Jimbo and Ned, Classi, Gerald Broflovski, and Moses, can be summoned during battle; Moses heals all allies while the others deliver powerful attacks.[18]\n","\n","The New Kid can manipulate time with their farts; this ability can be used in battle to skip an opponent's turn,[12] pause time to move around the grid and inflict out-of-turn damage,[5] or summon a past version of the New Kid to join the battle.[11] The New Kid's farting power can also be used to reverse time, fix objects, and pause time to avoid obstacles or fast-moving targets.[5] Some areas of the town are inaccessible until the player gains specific allies who can use the New Kid's farting power to overcome the obstacle: Captain Diabetes can be sent into a rage that allows him to move heavy objects; the Human Kite can fly the New Kid to otherwise unreachable heights;[3] Toolshed's sandblaster can clear paths that are blocked by lava that cause the player to combust;[8][19] and Professor Chaos can launch a hamster from the New Kid's rectum to reach and sabotage electrical panels.[20]\n","\n","The player can modify the New Kid's appearance, superpowers, gender, sexuality, race, and ethnicity at any time in the game.[21] Gender choices include male, female, and non-binary.[5][22] Costume items can be collected, mixed together and recolored but have no influence on the New Kid's abilities.[13] The New Kid's race selector is represented as a difficulty level slider, with lighter skin being easy and darker skin being harder.

As the cake is ready, however, Admiral is ran over and killed by Erik, a gang leader and bully from Atma's school. In a panic, Erik knocks out Atma, and takes the cake for himself to deliver to Raya as an apology. Catching up to Erik back at their school, Atma confronts and Spacedives him, revealing that he acts in this demeanor due to abuse from his father, leading to a desire to show no weakness, believing it makes him stronger. As Atma is about to exit Erik's mind, Nirmala suddenly appears, ejecting Atma back into the outside world and simultaneously turning Erik into a werewolf like monster. Raya intervenes, returning Erik to his normal form but paying no heed to his frantic apologies, and seemingly killing him before eating some of the cake, and passing out once more. Outside, the crack in the sky grows larger.\n","\n","Atma reawakens only to discover that Raya is nowhere to be found, and that the school is busy in preparation for the Lintang festival. Atma discovers that any attempts to ask about Raya's whereabouts result in the person being asked looping their words, then pretending nothing had happened at all. Moreover, teachers have suddenly began acting very bizarrely and taking on seemingly entirely different personas. With the help of fellow classmate Lulu, Atma engages in confrontations with the affected teachers and citizens, restoring them to normal, and discovering in the process that every single one of them had chastised Raya in some way or another, leading her to rewrite their personalities in retaliation. Atma also learns that Raya, being the class president, was tasked with organizing the festival, but failed to meet expectations and was under immense pressure as a result. Nirmala appears once again during a Spacedive and transforms Lulu into a humanoid swan.\n","\n","Atma finds Raya alone on a bridge overlooking the city, who supposedly kills Lulu and reveals that she simply exerted her control over the town, organizing the festival simply because she wanted to be happy with Atma.

Marin, a quiet classmate of Atma, rescues him and takes him to safety, giving him a wand that allows him to access alternate timelines due to the weakened state of the universe. Reaching the ruins of the school, Atma discovers Marin in confrontation with Raya, and narrowly protects her from Raya's powers. He finds himself in a Spacedive dimension and learns that Marin was once close friends with both Nirmala and Raya, but grew distrustful once learning about Atma, convinced he was an imaginary friend, and eventually neglecting to protect her in the face of harassment and bullying at school. Nirmala turns Marin into a humanoid snail, and Raya destroys her before falling unconscious.

One day, Atma drowned and died trying to save Nirmala, being unable to swim himself (Revealing the events of the game all took place inside Raya's mind). Raya, who was facing abuse from her father, in a moment of resentment separates \"Nirmala\" from herself, representing all of her hope and positivity and believing her to be at fault for Atma's death.

After avoiding an onslaught of attacks from Raya, her insecurities and traumatic memories of all of those who had abused her accumulate, allowing Atma to enter her mind.\n","\n","Atma finds himself in a memory of Raya's home, and learns that her father steadily became abusive due to increasing debt, and a disapproval over her creative endeavors, and that the story he and Nirmala wrote was an allegory for her life. He convinces Raya that attempting to manufacture her own happy ending is only hurting her more, and to stop running and to face her fears head on, leading her through a dark cave populated by those who had bullied her.

With no memory of his arrival, and the hotel being run by few robotic assistants, he eventually finds a circular phone, connecting him to 'Cooper'. During breakfast, the world slowly begins to distort around him. Cooper contacts him soon afterwards, initially attempting to lead him to the rooftop, explaining that he is trapped within a simulation against his will. However, due to the system rejecting Alex's credentials, it is forced upon him to explore each individual floor of the hotel, where the main mechanics of the game and puzzle elements are found.\n","\n","Throughout his exploration of the floors and its authentication protocols, he begins to remember events leading up to his \"checking in\" at the Penrose. Prior to the beginning of the game, his son, Robin, succumbed to an unknown illness. Due to changes in health care by Governor Crow, Alex and his wife Maddie ran up enormous medical bills, and despite numerous tests, Robin eventually died. In his grief, he proceeded to meticulously plan the murders of Matthews, the insurance underwriter who denied them coverage, Dr Wright, who failed to cure his son, and Governor Crow, who had radically changed medical care in the state. Maddie found out the plan after Alex murdered Matthews, forcibly committing him to the Penrose as both therapy and to protect him.\n","\n","Alex eventually reaches the roof, meeting the AI manager who confides that this is not the first time that Alex has tried to check out, and implores him to stay, and pleads that he will change the simulation once more to better fit his needs. At this, the player has the option to either stay within the Penrose, much to Cooper's horror, or to finally leave the Penrose and accept his fate.\n","\n","Gameplay[edit]\n","\n","The main mechanic of the game focuses around colours of blocks, swapping them around to bypass, or stand upon, different coloured gates. Eventually, the player is given the opportunity to use these colours to teleport around the levels using specifically placed panels. During these puzzles, snippets of the plot are revealed to the player. After the bulk of levels are completed, the player must sleep, listen to Cooper and piece together the story happening around them, and repeat the cycle.\n","\n","\n","Gameplay[edit]\n","\n","SpeedRunners is played as a fast-paced side-scroller. Players compete with each other to outrun their opponents by using grappling hooks, power-ups, items, and interactive environments. The screen moves with whoever is currently in the lead. \n","Falling behind far enough off the screen results in being eliminated. After a player is eliminated, the screen will start to get smaller, making it harder to stay alive. If no one gets eliminated in a set time, the screen will automatically start to get smaller. \n","\n","When all but one player is eliminated, the last player standing wins the round. The shrunken screen is restored to its original size, and another round starts after a countdown. A player must win 3 rounds to win the match altogether. \n","\n","Players are able to pick Trails (which show when a player is Sprinting) and a Character. Additionally, most Characters come with 4 different Skins, which change their color. Players can also form teams of 2 players before starting a match. Teams need to win 4 rounds instead of 3, and players in teams also share their Sprinting Meter.\n","\n","As the player progresses they earn experience based on their performance. Getting enough experience points causes the player to level up which unlocks new power-ups, levels, characters, and skins.[10] While most skins in the game are purely cosmetic, there is one mystery skin that hinders the players ability to play by giving them disadvantages in power ups and speed debuffs.\n","\n","\n","Gameplay[edit]\n","\n","Spellbreak was a projectile-based PvP shooter, however, unlike other shooters, it used gauntlets that fired magical spells in place of guns. Additionally, players could levitate and carry one 'Rune,' giving access to abilities like flight, teleportation or invisibility. Players could choose from one of six elemental classes: wind, fire, ice, lightning, stone and toxic, which granted in game benefits related to that element. Each player started with their class gauntlet permanently attached to them and could pick up one of the other five as a secondary. Gauntlets could deal a primary attack, called a spell, and a secondary attack, called a sorcery. Spells were limited by Mana which was an energy pool shared with levitation, while using a sorcery triggered a cooldown timer. Elements from different gauntlets could be combined to make spells more powerful, provide crowd control effects, or reduce others, depending on strategic desires.[5][6][7] According to the developer the game also included role-playing and roguelike elements.\n","\n","Game modes included battle royale and Clash, a team deathmatch. With the release of Chapter 2 on April 8, 2021, Dominion, a 5v5 mode featuring control points would replace Clash.[8]\n","\n","\n","None\n","Gameplay[edit]\n","\n","The player controls one of the four playable characters (Spelunker, Spelunkette, Dark Spelunker, and Spelunkette's Sister) in an attempt to discover treasures and reach the end of the expedition area for each level. There are a total of 100 stages to select from on a large world map. The map has four distinct sections with 25 levels each. Some of the stages occasionally become event stages - dropping an unusual amount of in-game currency or event items. This includes collaboration events featuring equipment based on other video game franchises. Once a stage has been selected, the player will have to navigate through the level by walking, jumping, and using tools at their disposal. The player can go on a solo expedition or join a six-player group online.\n","\n","A finite amount of energy is available to the player's character and complete depletion would lead to death. Energy can be resupplied at checkpoints scattered throughout the cave. In case of deaths, the player's character will respawn at the last checkpoint they have passed through. Deaths can be easily caused by the hazardous environment such as traps, creatures, and ghosts. The playable characters are also known as the weakest action heroes, and they can die if you jump or fall from a slightly higher platform.[2] Each level allows for two revives and a third death results in a game over screen. A continue can be purchased with moon gems. In multiplayer mode, other players can revive you at your last checkpoint even after you've expended your lives. However, they must reach you before the 30 second countdown ends.\n","\n","Each cave is split into multiple sections, and the player is required to progress through them in order. Once a section has been cleared, the player cannot return to the previous area unless the level is restarted. Treasures known as Litho-orbs can be found throughout the level alongside items required for progression - such as colored keys that open corresponding doors. Litho-orbs go through a process known as Litho-stone evaluation at the end of the stage. The orbs are broken apart to reveal the Litho-stone fragments hidden in them. The yield is randomized, but the player would not receive a duplicate fragment until it has been used or sold. A storage space of 999 slots is available for the fragments.\n","\n","Once all the fragments for a Litho-stone has been gathered, the player can complete it manually to receive the indicated equipment. Head and body equipment are available alongside accessories and pets. Equipment are used to enhance and provide new abilities for the playable characters. However, some equipment are specific to certain characters. An inventory box is available for equipment that offers 30 slots initially. The player can expand the box by five slots for every 100 moon gems. Moon gem is a premium currency purchasable through microtransactions. In spite of that, there are also in-game methods for earning them as well. Another currency, gold, can be obtained through normal gameplay. Gold can be used to upgrade equipment.\n","\n","Equipment can also be gained through a method known as Doggie Digging. The feature can be accessed through the menu. The player can use in-game items, such as candies and cakes, to feed an orange spotted dog named Pooch. Pooch will then dig up a completed equipment. If those items are unavailable, the player can use moon gems instead.\n","\n","\n","Gameplay[edit]\n","\n","The player controls an unnamed adventurer, known as the spelunker. The aim of the game is to explore tunnels, gathering as much treasure as possible while avoiding traps and enemies. The spelunker can whip or jump on enemies to defeat them, pick up items that can be thrown to either attack enemies or set off traps, and use a limited supply of bombs and ropes to navigate the caves. Levels are randomly generated and grouped into four increasingly difficult \"areas\", each with a distinctive set of items, enemies, terrain types and special features. Later areas contain more valuable treasures, secret locations, and items. If the player loses all their hearts or runs into an instant-kill trap, they will have to start from the beginning.\n","\n","Enemies include animals like bats, snakes and spiders of varying sizes, other characters, and monsters like yeti, man-eating plants and ghosts. The player can collect many items, mainly gold and jewels which add to the player's score, but also useful objects including bombs, guns, climbing gear and archaeological artifacts. Some of the latter have supernatural abilities, including kapalas, hedjets, crystal skulls and golden ankhs, though many of these special items can only be gained through secret methods, like combining other items together. Some items may be purchased or stolen from shops scattered about the caves, though the shopkeepers become powerful enemies if the player steals from them.\n","\n","The player can also encounter damsels in distress trapped in the caves, who can be picked up and carried to an exit. Successfully doing so returns health to the player. It's possible to unlock the damsel as a playable character; gameplay is identical, except that the player encounters spelunkers to rescue. Another unlockable character is the \"Tunnel Man\", who possesses a mattock instead of a whip.\n","\n","The Xbox Live Arcade, as well as the PlayStation Network versions of the game feature local multiplayer (co-op and deathmatch) for up to four players.[9] There are 9 different characters to play as.\n","\n","The original Spelunky also includes a level editor, in which players can create their own non-random levels to share with others.\n","\n","\n","Gameplay[edit]\n","\n","Like its predecessor, Spelunky 2 is a 2D platform game. In the game, the player assumes control of Ana, the daughter of the explorer from the first game, who visits the Moon in order to find her missing parents.[1] In the game, Ana must navigate deadly caves filled with hostile enemies and traps to collect treasures. When Ana dies, she will have to start from the beginning of the game and lose all of her items, and the game is rearranged through procedural generation to present new challenges and paths. Each level also features several layers which can be explored by the player.[2] New areas, such as the lava-themed Volcana, are introduced. The game features a new liquid physics system, in which fluid will flow naturally throughout a level. In addition, the game introduces new monsters, traps, and ridable mounts.[3] The game also supports four-player online multiplayer, with the introduction of both cooperative and competitive multiplayer modes.[4][5]\n","\n","Plot[edit]\n","\n","The game's story concerns Ana Spelunky, daughter of previous Spelunky protagonist Guy Spelunky, as she ventures to the Moon to find her missing parents. Like the first game, the story and aesthetics draw inspiration from several cultures, featuring mythological figures like Olmec, Kali, Osiris, Lamassu and Tiamat.\n","\n","\n","Plot[edit]\n","\n","The fictional version of Egypt in which the game is set is in a period of turmoil when the player is introduced to Sphinx, one of the main protagonists. He and his fellow apprentice Horus are given the task of retrieving the legendary Blade of Osiris by their master, Imhotep. They are taken to Uruk, \"the land of darkness\", where they eventually find the Blade. Horus is attacked and supposedly killed by a deadly ray that protects the Castle of Uruk. Sphinx retrieves the Blade, but while trying to escape is also attacked by the ray and forced to travel to an unknown location through the use of a portal system.[4]\n","\n","Meanwhile, the young Prince Tutenkhamen of Luxor celebrates his birthday, but his older brother, Akhenaten, captures him and performs a ritual that turns him into a mummy. Sphinx arrives and interrupts the ritual, causing Tutenkhamen, Akhenaten and his henchman Menes to be teleported to the Castle of Uruk. Sphinx learns that fragments of Tutenkhamen's soul are stored in Canopic Vases, and takes on the task of recollecting them to restore him to his former self. In the Castle, Akhenaten gloats that the recent events were nothing but a minor setback. The player then learns that \"Akhenaten\" is in fact the dark god Set in disguise, and that the real Akhenaten was mummified in the same way as Tutenkhamen to allow Set to assume his form. However, because of Sphinx's actions he cannot disguise himself as Tutenkhamen to take power in Luxor as planned.\n","\n","Sphinx and Imhotep devise a plan to use the Mummy/Tutenkhamen's immortality to their benefit; a single Canopic Vase is able to bring him to life for a short while, but he still remains practically dead allowing him to safely venture the trap-riddled Castle of Uruk. Imhotep creates Bas-ket, who can sneak inside the castle to deliver the Vases to the Mummy. Throughout the story, the Mummy exploits his inability to be killed to survive the traps and retrieve valuable items to aid Sphinx in his quest. In return, Sphinx finds more Canopic Vases over the course of the game and uses Bas-ket to send them to his undead ally.[5]\n","\n","During his time in the city of Heliopolis, Sphinx learns that the god Anubis has caused great suffering to the people of the land; most prominently, he cast many of them into stone statues. Sphinx's heroic nature appeals to Anubis, and gradually allows him to free the people from their stone curse. However, the tasks given to Sphinx become more dangerous over time. Anubis asks him to retrieve \"Sacred Crowns\", immensely powerful objects once used by the gods of Egypt.[6]\n","\n","The first crown to retrieve is the Sacred Crown of Abydos, a city barraged by various disasters and troubles (though not apparent at first, the chaos is the work of Set). Most recently, the Mayor falls very ill and the Crown almost falls into the hands of his traitorous aides. Sphinx is able to save him and in return is rewarded with the crown.[7]\n","\n","Each crown presents a greater challenge for Sphinx than the previous; he battles and defeats the fearsome Geb Queen for possession of the Sacred Crown of Uruk, and the pharaoh of Heliopolis for the Crown of Heliopolis. As Sphinx proves his might to Anubis, the enigmatic god reveals he cast the people of Heliopolis into stone to protect them from the darkness that will soon descend upon Egypt at the hands of Set.[8]\n","\n","The Mummy discovers The Sacred Crown of Set, the final crown, in the depths of The Castle of Uruk. He takes it and this greatly weakens the ray protecting the castle. Bas-ket is able to escape with the crown, but Set catches the Mummy and paralyses him.[9]\n","\n","With all four Sacred Crowns, Anubis is able to summon Osiris, another god who reveals he and Set were once a single form named Ra. Set, however, became greedy and stole power from Osiris to take over Egypt. Osiris uses the last of his power to transport Sphinx past the defenses of The Castle of Uruk, where he challenges Set for the fate of all Egypt. Set takes on his \"true form\"; a hideous monster with immense power, but Sphinx is able to defeat him. Set is not destroyed, indeed Imhotep appears and tells Sphinx that this is not in his destiny. Instead, Osiris arrives and forcibly reunites himself with the weakened Set and Ra is formed once again. Ra gives the Mummy the last Canopic Vase, but the Mummy tragically falls and breaks it. As the game ends on a cliffhanger, Imhotep states there may be other ways to help Tutenkhamen regain his human form.[10]\n","\n","\n","Plot[edit]\n","\n","Spice and Wolf's story revolves around Kraft Lawrence, a 25-year-old traveling merchant who peddles various goods from town to town to make a living in a stylized, fictional world, with a  historical setting with European influences.[7] His main goal in life is to gather enough money to start his own shop, and he already has been traveling for seven years while gaining experience in the trade. One night when stopped at the town of Pasloe, he finds in his wagon a wolf-deity named Holo who is over 600 years old. She takes the form of a 15-year-old girl, except for a wolf's tail and ears. She introduces herself as the town's goddess of harvest, who has kept it blessed with good harvests of wheat for many years. Holo has experienced increasing isolation and disillusionment at the townpeople's move away from her protection towards their own methods of increasing the harvest.  She is especially hurt at their forgetting of the promise made between her and a farmer when she arrived in the village and their criticism of her as a \"fickle god\" for needing to replenish the soil with smaller harvests.  Because of these changes, she wants to go back to her homeland in the north called Yoitsu; she believes the people have already forsaken her and that she has kept her promise to maintain the good harvests. Holo also wants to travel to see how the world has changed while she has remained in one place for many years. She manages to bargain her way out of the village by making a deal with Lawrence to take her with him. As they travel, her wisdom helps increase his profits, but at the same time, her true nature draws unwanted attention from the Church.\n","\n","\n","None\n","Gameplay[edit]\n","\n","Spiritfarer is an indie adventure game developed by Thunder Lotus Games where the player must meet the needs of the spirits aboard their ship with foods and building boat additions to accommodate those spirits' desires and needs.

These new sections that are added to the ship are placed like a game of Tetris, stacked up on top of one another in any way that fits. The characters that Stella meets along the way also give the player mini-games to play for materials and in-game currency that are relevant to the spirit's character.

As Stella sends off more and more spirits, she soon begins occasionally encountering Hades, in the form of a giant owl. Hades shows Stella images of what are apparently her past life as a palliative care nurse, taking care of terminally ill patients before falling terminally ill herself. Hades then questions Stella's motivations, wondering whether her desire to help spirits is truly altruistic or simply a selfish means to ease her own insecurities.\n","\n","Eventually, Stella sends off the last spirit through the Everdoor and she has one final confrontation with Hades. Hades reveals that Stella's real body is on the verge of death in the real world, and it is now her time to pass through the Everdoor.

Ink is also used to cover the ground, or any paintable surface, in order to swim or refill their ink tanks. Inklings and Octolings can morph between humanoid, or kid form, where they switch from walking and shooting, into squid form where they can quickly swim through ink of their own color, and replenish their ink supply, as well as return to full health.\n","\n","The sequel adds new main, sub and special weapons, including dual-wield pistols called Dualies that allow the player to perform dodge rolls, shotgun-like weapons called Brellas that enable defensive maneuvers with folding shields, and jetpacks known as Inkjets. Like the previous game, it features the standard Turf War mode for Regular Battles, in which two four-player teams have three minutes to cover the most turf with their color of ink. Splatoon 2 also maintains the first game's rotation of Splat Zones, Tower Control and Rainmaker for Ranked Battles, which is unlocked when you reach level ten, while also adding a new Clam Blitz mode. League Battles allow players to form teams with friends playing the same modes as in Ranked Battles, however, they removed tri-squad as a possible team option, making it so you can only create teams of two or four and for ranked battles the time limit is five minutes instead of three. A new mode, Salmon Run, allows up to four players to team up cooperatively to tackle waves of enemies called Salmonids and collect Boss Salmonids' eggs.[11][12]\n","\n","Once per month until July 2019, a \"Splatfest\" event was held in which players could choose one of two teams, usually based on common debates such as heroes versus villains and pancakes versus waffles. In addition, there were two collaborations during these Splatfests: Nickelodeon's Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Super Smash Bros. Ultimate.[13] Splatfest themes were usually announced two weeks in advance, and players were given the ability to choose their team in the game's lobby. Themes were usually region-specific and happen at different times of the month. The only mode available in a Splatfest was Turf War, but players could choose between normal and pro modes. Winning battles awarded 'clout' to the winning team, and at the end of the Splatfest, the winning side was decided by evaluating popularity and clout earned in both battle modes. All players who participate earn rare rewards, but players on the winning team receive a slightly higher cut.[14][15] In July 2019, Nintendo announced that the final regular Splatfest would be held that month.[16] However, bonus rematches of previous Splatfests were held in May 2020,[17][18] August 2020, and October 2020.[19] A Splatfest celebrating the 35th anniversary of Super Mario Bros. was held in January 2021.[20]\n","\n","The game features a single-player campaign called Hero Mode, in which the player rescues captured Zapfish across various levels while fighting off evil Octarians. Unlike the previous game's single-player campaign which had a pre-determined weapon set, the player can now earn various weapons, some of which are required when playing levels for the first time. In addition to Sunken Scrolls that unlock artwork and in-game lore, players can collect Power Orbs to upgrade their Hero Mode weapons, and tickets that can be exchanged for temporary reward boosts in multiplayer battles, such as increased experience to level up quicker or more in-game money.[21] Using a single weapon to beat all of the Hero Mode levels grants the player a Hero Weapon Replica (identical to the campaign weapon) to use in multiplayer matches. Players can also play multiplayer online through an internet connection or play locally, although local play requires multiple consoles and copies of the game. The game also features LAN support with an adapter accessory for local private tournaments.

Players choose to be either an Inkling or Octoling as their player character. Both wield weaponry that uses colored ink. Weapons are diverse in ability and imagery, with most resembling household objects. For example, Rollers are large paint rollers that can cover large amounts of area in ink but are generally limited to close-range combat. At the same time, Chargers are weapons which resemble a sniper rifle, and have long range for sniping opponents but are less effective at painting the ground. Splatoon 3 expands upon this by adding new main and special weapons to the game.[6] Main weapons are able to be chosen by the player, while special weapons are assigned to specific main weapons and require the player to cover the ground with a varying amount of ink in order to charge it up. Inklings and Octolings have the ability to morph into a squid or octopus form respectively. This form is referred to as the \"swim form\",[c] and can be used to climb ink-covered walls or swim through ink faster than the humanoid forms can walk.[7] Weapons have a finite amount of ink ammunition, and submerging in ink via the swim form replenishes it quicker than in humanoid form.

Each game is a 3D platformer featuring the titular protagonist, a juvenile purple dragon named Spyro, as he attempts to restore peace in a set of worlds specific to each game by vanquishing enemies. Spyro's sidekick, a dragonfly named Sparx, acts as an indicator of his health, defending him from a limited number of enemy attacks. Additionally, the games feature a number of collectibles which must be acquired to make progress, such as gems, which also act as currency, and dragon eggs.\n","\n","Spyro Reignited Trilogy attempts to mostly remain faithful to the gameplay of the original games. Each level is designed to match the size and layout of the levels in the originals.[1] A few features included only in one or two of the original trilogy were unified across all three games in Reignited, such as the addition of \"skill points\" in the first game, or Spyro's ability to roll from side-to-side in later installments.\n","\n","The remaster also made a few changes to content in the originals that was no longer considered appropriate.

Additionally, a genie character in Ripto's Rage! had its name changed from \"Bombo\" to \"Bob the Flagkeeper\" to avoid referencing a stereotype of Arabs and Muslims common since before the publication of the original game.[1]\n","\n","However, most of the game's differences from the originals center around quality-of-life improvements. All the character's dialogues were re-recorded in their entirety with Tom Kenny providing Spyro's voice in all three games of Reignited.[2] Visual graphics were overhauled, and non-playable characters were given more distinct and varied personalities.

The podracer will also be destroyed if one or both engines sustain severe damage from colliding into too many walls or obstacles, requiring the player to steer carefully to avoid falling behind.

En route to the Academy, Jaden befriends fellow student Rosh Penin (Jason Marsden), but the students' shuttle is suddenly shot down by an unknown enemy. Jaden and Rosh make their way to the Academy, where the former witnesses a woman using a staff to drain energy from the Temple; Jaden subsequently gets knocked out. Jaden is woken by Luke Skywalker (Bob Bergen) and Kyle Katarn (Jeff Bennett), who welcome them to the Academy. Jaden and Rosh are assigned to study under Kyle, but during their first training session, Rosh's over-competitiveness endangers Jaden. After the Jedi students complete their initial training, they are assigned various peace-keeping missions across the galaxy. During this time, Rosh becomes jealous of Jaden and begins to believe Kyle is trying to hold him back.\n","\n","After several successful missions, Luke calls the students back to the Academy to tell them he has identified the Dark Jedi who attacked the Temple as members of a Sith cult called the Disciples of Ragnos. A member of the cult, the Twi'lek Alora (Grey DeLisle), infiltrated the Academy during the attack and stole Luke's journal, containing the locations of numerous places strong with the Force. Believing the cult is looking to drain their Force energy, Luke sends the students to investigate each location. Jaden travels to Hoth, where they find Imperial presence at the Rebel Alliance's abandoned Echo Base and encounter Alora, who flees after a brief duel. Returning to the Academy, Jaden reports their findings, but is saddened to learn Rosh never returned from his mission to Byss.\n","\n","After Jaden completes more missions and has several run-ins with the Disciples, they and Kyle travel to Darth Vader's abandoned fortress on Vjun—one of the few places strong with the Force supposedly unvisited by the Disciples—and find it crawling with stormtroopers and Dark Jedi. The pair fight them, but are eventually separated. Jaden encounters Rosh, who has fallen to the dark side and joined the Disciples to avoid being killed after they had captured him. Jaden defeats Rosh as Kyle arrives, but both are incapacitated by Tavion Axmis (Kath Soucie), the Disciples' leader and Rosh's new master.[c] Tavion uses the Scepter of Ragnos, which can absorb and release Force energy, to trap Jaden and Kyle under debris, but the pair manage to escape, though the former's lightsaber is destroyed in the process. At the Academy, Jaden and Kyle inform Luke of their findings, and the former is honored for their actions by being promoted to the rank of Jedi Knight.\n","\n","After building a new lightsaber, Jaden begins dismantling the Disciples' operations as they complete more missions, while Luke discovers that Tavion plans to use the stolen Force energy to resurrect the ancient Sith Lord Marka Ragnos (Peter Lurie), who is buried on Korriban. While the Jedi prepare to go there, Kyle convinces Jaden to accompany him to a mining facility on Taspir III, from where Rosh has sent a distress signal. The pair split up and Jaden eventually finds Rosh, who claims he wants to redeem himself, but Jaden's feelings of betrayal quickly manifest into anger. Alora tries to goad them into killing Rosh and joining the Disciples, while Kyle senses Jaden's anger and tries to telepathically dissuade them. If the player chooses the light side, Jaden forgives Rosh, but an enraged Alora attacks them and cuts off the latter's arm. If the player chooses the dark side, Jaden kills Rosh, but refuses to join the Disciples, instead seeking the Scepter's power for themselves. Either way, Jaden kills Alora and leaves for Korriban.\n","\n","Jaden fights their way to Ragnos' tomb, where they confront Tavion and defeat her. If Jaden is light-sided, they spare Tavion, who completes the resurrection process, causing Ragnos' spirit to possess her. Jaden destroys the Scepter and defeats Ragnos, who leaves Tavion's lifeless body and returns to his tomb. At the Academy, Jaden reunites with Rosh, who has been outfitted with a prosthetic arm, and is honored by Luke, Kyle and the other Jedi. If Jaden is dark-sided, they kill Tavion and claim the Scepter as Kyle arrives to confront them, but Jaden defeats him and buries him under debris. They later take command of Tavion's Star Destroyer, while Kyle is rescued by Luke and vows to hunt Jaden down, though Luke assures him that there is still good in their fallen apprentice.[15]\n","\n","\n","None\n","None\n","None\n","None\n","Gameplay[edit]\n","\n","The game features some gameplay elements that resemble features in other first-person shooters. The heads-up display (HUD) shows the player character's helmet, with a tactical visor. The player acts as squad leader of a squad of four elite troops. The squadmate order system allows the player general tactical control over the three non-player characters (NPCs) squadmates that round out the four-man commando team. Many objects in the game environment will highlight when the crosshair is placed over them. The player can then press the \"use\" key to issue an order automatically associated with the object; for example, a sealed door may highlight with a synchronized team breach-and-clear command, or a computer console might have a \"slice\" (computer hacking) command, while a pile of cargo boxes suitable for a cover position with good vantage may provide a \"take up Sniper/Anti-Armor position\" command. Where possible, the squadmates will usually take their preferred roles (sniper, demolitions and technical). The player can order the squad to move to secure any position (wherever the crosshair is pointed), or perform search-and-destroy. There are orders to command the squadmates to group up or spread out according to the player's discretion for the situation.\n","\n","In single-player mode, the player and squadmates do not die when they run out of health, but rather are incapacitated. If the player character is downed, the player can order the squad members to attempt to revive the player or to continue with their current orders. Therefore, the game is only truly over when the player and all members of the squad are incapacitated at once or if the player is downed in a position their squadmates cannot reach (such as chasms). Certain missions may require squad members to split up to accomplish various isolated objectives, and in such scenarios, where the player is operating alone, losing all the player's health also results in a game over. While reviving a downed commando restores a small amount of health, bacta charging stations are necessary to fully regain it.\n","\n","Weapons can be acquired in both single player and multiplayer. Throughout the campaign, the player always carrys the compact DC-17 and a blaster pistol with unlimited ammo. The DC-17 can be configured into an assault rifle, sniper rifle, and grenade launcher. The player may also use weapons dropped by enemies.\n","\n","Republic Commando maintains a first-person perspective throughout the game, presenting the story from the eyes of Delta Squad's squad leader, RC-1138 (\"Boss\"). His squadmates include RC-1262 (\"Scorch\"), a talkative explosives expert; RC-1140 (\"Fixer\"), a skilled hacker and a dedicated soldier; and RC-1207 (\"Sev\"), the squad's sniper who enjoys racking up kills. Information is received via radio commands from a clone officer (referred to as \"Advisor\"), and a text-based objective list with a pop-up objective tracker arrow that points the player to the next objective.\n","\n","\n","Gameplay[edit]\n","\n","The Force Unleashed is a third-person action game in which the player's character's weapons are the Force and a lightsaber.[7] Developers treated the main character's lightsaber like another Force power, and wanted to ensure \"something visceral and cool\" happened with each button-push.[7] The game has a combo system for stringing lightsaber attacks and for combining lightsaber attacks with Force powers.[7] Experience points earned by killing enemies and finding artifacts can be used to increase Starkiller's powers and traits.[8] The gameplay is intended to be easy to learn; the development team included \"horrible\" gamers to help ensure the game's accessibility.[9] Players can casually run and gun through the game, but the game rewards those who take a stealthy, more tactical approach.[9] The game includes enemies that are easy to overcome; game difficulty arises from presenting these enemies in large numbers that can wear down the player's character.[10] Additionally, enemies learn from the player's character's attacks; using the same attack on different characters can sometimes lead to the player's character doing less damage.[11] The enemies, which number over 50, have various strengths and weaknesses; developers faced the difficulty of effectively placing them throughout the game's varied environments.[10]\n","\n","Plot[edit]\n","\n","Shortly into the Galactic Empire's rule, Imperial spies locate a Jedi survivor of the Great Purge named Kento Marek on Kashyyyk. Darth Vader arrives as the planet is invaded and eliminates any Wookie resistance between him and the fugitive Jedi. Reaching Kento's home,[17][18] Vader easily defeats him in a lightsaber duel but senses someone far more powerful nearby.  Initially believing it to be Kento's Jedi Master, Vader prepares to execute the defiant Jedi until his lightsaber is suddenly force pulled from his hand by Kento's son Galen. Sensing the boy's strong connection to the Force, Vader proceeds to kill Kento and an Imperial squadron after they try to execute Galen and secretly takes him as his apprentice with only a select few knowing of his existence.\n","\n","Years later, an adult Galen (given the alias \"Starkiller\") completes his Sith training. He is sent by Vader to eliminate several Jedi survivors across the galaxy in preparation for assassinating the Emperor so that the two of them can rule the galaxy together. Starkiller travels aboard his personal ship, the Rogue Shadow, alongside training droid PROXY (who is programmed to try and kill Starkiller) and Imperial pilot Juno Eclipse.[19] Starkiller's targets include Rahm Kota, a Clone Wars veteran and leader of a militia;[d] Kazdan Paratus, insane after years of isolation on Raxus Prime;[e] and Shaak Ti, who is hiding on Felucia. As they duel, Kota senses that Vader will not always be Starkiller's master and that he will be part of his future before being blinded with his own lightsaber and falling to his seeming death. Before she dies, Shaak Ti warns Starkiller that he will eventually be betrayed by Vader. His final mission complete, Starkiller meets with Vader, but the Emperor arrives, his spies having uncovered Starkiller's existence. To prove his loyalty to the Emperor, Vader swiftly impales his apprentice and hurls him into space.\n","\n","Unbeknownst to the Emperor, Vader has Starkiller recovered and resuscitated. Vader sends Starkiller to foster a rebellion among the Empire's enemies, hoping to distract the Emperor's spies for Vader to overthrow him. Starkiller rescues Juno, who had been arrested and branded a traitor to the Empire, and escapes with her and PROXY. Looking for allies to aid his mission, Starkiller finds an alive Kota on Cloud City, rendered blind and reduced to alcoholism, and rescues him from Imperial forces.\n","\n","The group travels to Kashyyyk to locate Kota's contact, senator Bail Organa. Starkiller discovers his old home and meets his father's spirit, who expresses remorse for Starkiller's upbringing under Vader.[f] To gain Bail's trust, Starkiller rescues his captive daughter Princess Leia Organa, and liberates the enslaved Wookiees at her request. Starkiller learns from Kota that Bail went missing on Felucia, after searching for Shaak Ti in the hope she would rescue Leia. Starkiller travels to Felucia to find Bail, discovering he had been captured by Shaak Ti's former apprentice Maris Brood, who succumbed to the Dark Side after her master's death. Starkiller defeats Brood but spares her life, and convinces Bail to join the rebellion.\n","\n","To convince more dissidents to do the same, Vader suggests that Starkiller attack a Star Destroyer facility on Raxus Prime to show that the Empire is vulnerable. Juno learns Starkiller is still serving Vader and chastises him, but agrees to keep silent. On Raxus Prime, Starkiller is attacked by PROXY, who attempts to fulfill his programming by killing him, but Starkiller defeats him, destroys the facility, and pulls a falling Star Destroyer out of the sky using the Force.[g] Bail meets with fellow senators Mon Mothma and Garm Bel Iblis on Corellia to formally organize a rebellion, only for Vader to arrive and arrest them and Kota. After overpowering Starkiller, Vader reveals that he was merely a tool to lure out the Empire's enemies, and had never intended to use him to overthrow the Emperor. Starkiller escapes after PROXY sacrifices himself by attacking Vader.\n","\n","Juno rescues Starkiller, who uses the Force to see that Kota and the senators are being held on the Death Star. After Juno kisses him and he bids farewell, Starkiller battles his way through the station to reach the Emperor's throne room. Vader confronts him, but Starkiller defeats his former master and faces the Emperor, who tries to goad him into killing Vader so Starkiller can take his place.

At this point, the player must choose between saving Kota (Light Side) or killing Vader (Dark Side).\n","\n","\n","Gameplay[edit]\n","\n","Stardew Valley is a farming simulation game primarily inspired by the video game series Story of Seasons.[1] At the start of the game, players create a character, who becomes the recipient of a plot of land and a small house once owned by their grandfather in a small town called Pelican Town. Players may select from several different farm types, each with a unique theme and different benefits and drawbacks.[2] The farmland is initially overrun with boulders, trees, stumps, and weeds, and players must work to clear them to restart the farm, tending to crops and livestock to generate revenue and further expand the farm's buildings and facilities.\n","\n","Players interact with non-player characters (NPCs) that inhabit the town, including engaging in relationships with them; this can culminate in marriage, which results in the NPC helping the player's character to tend the farm.  After marriage, players may have the chance to have or adopt a child with their spouse.  Players can also engage in fishing, cooking, crafting, and exploring procedurally-generated caves with materials and ores to mine or creatures to combat. Players can take on various quests to earn additional money or complete specific collections of materials (called \"bundles\") to restore the town's Community Center or pay certain amounts of money to complete JojaMart bundles. Completing bundles rewards players with various items, including seeds and tools. Completing multiple bundles grants players access to new areas and game mechanics, such as a desert.[3] All of these activities must be metered against the character's current health and exhaustion level, and the game's internal clock. The player can consume food that grants certain buffs that are useful in certain activities and situations. Food is also a source of replenishing health and energy, which allows the player to complete more tasks in a given day. The game uses a simplified calendar, each year having four 28-day months that represent each season, that determines which crops can be grown and which activities can be beneficial. Later in the game, players can restore a greenhouse and an island that can grow any crop regardless of the season.\n","\n","\n","None\n","Gameplay[edit]\n","\n","The game is played through a third-person perspective. There is no combat involved in the game, instead gameplay mostly revolves around interacting with other characters, solving puzzles and doing mini games.

Players can, for example, interact with photos of the main character Richard's family. The game also focuses on exploring a wide variety of locations.[2][3]\n","\n","Plot[edit]\n","\n","State of Mind unfolds in Berlin in 2048 and revolves around Richard Nolan, a journalist waking up in a hospital after an explosion, finding out that his family is nowhere to be found.

The objective of the game is to investigate the mines underneath the old Western town Tumbleton in order to unearth the secrets lurking below. The player controls Rusty, a steam-powered robot who is equipped with a pickaxe, but can gain access to a variety of tools, such as a drill and dynamite. The player can upgrade the tools used for digging as progression is made in the game. Besides health, the player also needs coal for light, and water for special abilities.\n","\n","SteamWorld Dig has platform elements in that the player runs, jumps and encounters foes, but the main objective is mining. That means that the player builds – or rather deconstructs – the game world and creates platforms that way. The player collects ores and resources which can be brought back to the surface and exchanged for cash. When the player progresses in the game, new abilities are unlocked. Each playthrough, the mines are randomized, making items and treasure appear in different locations. If the player gets stuck there is a self-destruct function, but the players can also buy ladders in the store at the surface to get out of tricky situations.\n","\n","When progressing deeper down in the cave, the player encounters various enemies with different attack patterns and weak spots. The game features multiple subterranean worlds, each with a completely different environment. Dying results in a reparation penalty fee, and the player respawns back on the surface.

Gameplay largely involves exploring a vast underground mine, coming up against enemy creatures while finding various resources as the player digs their way downwards. As the game progresses, Dorothy can gain abilities and weapons such as pressure bombs, a hookshot, and a pneumatic arm that can punch through rock. Any resources found can be traded in for cash in the game's hub world, where the player can upgrade their health, weapons, and abilities. Each of the weapons have perks that can be activated by installing Upgrade Cogs found in secret areas. More blueprints for upgrades become available to the player by either increasing their level by killing enemies or completing quests, or by finding artifacts hidden in the mines.\n","\n","Plot[edit]\n","\n","The story takes place in between the events of SteamWorld Dig and SteamWorld Heist.[8] Following Rusty's disappearance at the end of SteamWorld Dig, Dorothy, a robot who he had befriended, travels to the mining town of El Machino in order to search for him. Along the way, she comes across Fen, a remnant of the Vectron that Rusty had previously fought, who joins Dorothy as a navigator. While searching the mines for Rusty while also hearing rumors of him turning into a monstrous machine, Dorothy comes across a group of devolved humans, addicted to the drug moon juice. The humans are led by Rosie, who instead of becoming addicted to moon juice took to lifting weights at a young age and who is much smarter than the other humans, called shiners. \n","\n","Rosie claims that mysterious machines are triggering earthquakes. Dorothy goes to destroy these machines, only to discover that Rosie had lied to her.

The player has the option of beating an enemy to death with melee strikes or to transform them into zombies. Stubbs' zombie state prevents him from wielding any conventional weapons, and instead wields a variety of improvised weaponry and combat techniques, most of which are done using a specific body part as explosives or makeshift devices. Stubbs can drive a wide variety of vehicles, such as cars, tractors and tanks. All of the aforementioned improvised weapons, excluding Stubbs' hand, will convert enemies they kill into zombies. Stubbs can herd zombies which are in range by whistling. Since there is a limit to how many zombies will follow him at a time, Stubbs can guide the rest by sending whole groups of zombies in a direction with a single shove. Stubbs' zombie followers can kill humans and eat their brains, just like Stubbs can, and any human killed by one of his minions will also turn into a zombie. An enemy that fires upon a zombie in a group will attract the attention of all the rest of the zombies. Crowds of zombies serve as a great shield when approaching enemies armed with ranged weapons and are needed for sowing the necessary chaos and confusion into a difficult melee.\n","\n","Plot[edit]\n","\n","In 1959, Andrew Monday, multi-billionaire playboy industrialist has founded the futuristic utopian city, Punchbowl, in Pennsylvania. During its opening ceremony, deceased traveling salesman, Edward \"Stubbs\" Stubblefield, rises from his grave as a Zombie and begins to consume the brains of Punchbowl's inhabitants, quickly creating his own army of the undead, and causing increasing amounts of havoc as the Zombies clash with the various militant factions of the area. As things begin to escalate, Stubbs heads to The Punchbowl Police Station where he is captured and the police chief plans to dance on Stubbs' grave. Stubbs manages to escape by ripping his hand off and using it to control a scientist to release his restraints. Stubbs makes his way to the chief's office where they have a dance-off before the chief dances to the armory, unaware he has Stubbs' pancreas stuck to him. It then explodes, killing him.\n","\n","As Stubbs continues his path of destruction, he comes across Otis, a paranoid, trigger-happy leader of a local redneck militia called \"The Quaker State Irregulars\" who believes the Zombie outbreak is part of a Communist infiltration mission. Stubbs follows Otis back to his farm where he gives a rousing speech (consisting of only the word \"Brains\" in various cadences) to his fellow Zombies in a parody of the war film Patton. Upon cornering Otis, Stubbs seems to be at a disadvantage, as Otis has prepared a large stockpile of TNT which he intends to detonate, killing them both. But before he can light it, Otis seems to recognize Stubbs from when he was alive and begins to panic. This gives Stubbs the chance to light the TNT himself and escape to a safe distance before the house is blown up. He then rides a bewildered sheep back to Punchbowl. Stubbs goes to the dam where he relieves his bladder by urinating in the town's water supply, contaminating it. He then causes the dam to explode by having the other Zombies use themselves as electrical conduits.\n","\n","Upon arriving at City Hall to confront Andrew, Maggie (Andrew's very attractive mother), realizes the Zombie looks familiar and stops Andrew from shooting him, proclaiming her love for Stubbs. She explains that 26 years ago, during The Great Depression, she was a young country girl living at her family's farm. Stubbs, still a living man at the time, arrived at their house in an attempt to do business. Finding him extremely charismatic, Maggie took Stubbs back to her room where the two had sex. Unfortunately, Maggie's father, Otis, returned home and caught the two together. Unbeknownst to Maggie, he had killed Stubbs and dumped his body in the wilderness (in the same spot where Punchbowl would later be built). Maggie also reveals that she became pregnant with Andrew from the experience, making Stubbs his biological father. This is revealed to be the cause of Stubbs' inordinate infatuation with Maggie shown throughout the game. The two share a romantic embrace, which is abruptly cut off by Stubbs eating her brains. Enraged by seeing his mother murdered and learning the truth of his conception, Andrew attacks Stubbs from behind a forcefield, partially destroying Punchbowl in the process. Stubbs survives the battle and attempts to murder Andrew, but is stopped by Maggie, who has become a Zombie herself. As Punchbowl is destroyed by a nuclear strike in an effort to contain the outbreak, Stubbs and Maggie sail off in a small rowboat and \"live\" happily ever after. During the credits, photos of things that happened during the events of the game are shown on the left.\n","\n","\n","Gameplay[edit]\n","\n","Subnautica is a survival action-adventure game set in an open world environment and played from a first-person perspective. The player controls the lone survivor of the Aurora, Ryley Robinson, as he is stranded on a remote ocean planet known as 4546B.\n","\n","The main objective is to explore the ocean and survive its dangers, while completing tasks to advance the plot. Players can collect resources, construct tools, build bases, submersibles, and interact with the planet's wildlife.[1][2][3]\n","\n","Some of the most extreme dangers to the player include dangerous fauna like Crabsquids, Stalkers, Crashfish, and Leviathan-class lifeforms like the Reaper, Sea Dragon and Ghost Leviathans.\n","\n","The majority of the game is set underwater, with two explorable islands hidden across the map, and a simulated day-and-night cycle that affects visibility. Upon beginning a new game, players are given an option between four difficulty modes:\n","\n","The game supports VR headsets, such as the HTC Vive and the Oculus Rift, with the additional input of a keyboard and mouse or game controller.[4]\n","\n","Plot[edit]\n","\n","Subnautica takes place in a distant spacefaring future. The Aurora, a deep-space vessel constructed by the Alterra Corporation, has been sent to a system at the outer reaches of known space on its maiden voyage under the pretenses of constructing high-speed space travel infrastructure. Unknown to the crew is that the ship was also sent to the system to search for and, possibly, rescue the crew of a ship named the Degasi, which crashed on planet 4546B ten years prior. As the Aurora does a gravity slingshot around 4546B, it is attacked by a mysterious energy-pulse and crashes on the planet. Several crew members manage to eject from the ship in escape pods, but only the player character—non-essential systems maintenance chief Ryley Robinson—survives. \n","\n","During this time, Ryley repairs the radio in his lifepod and gets messages through it from a trading ship called Sunbeam, led by Captain Avery Quinn. Quinn talks to Ryley and states that Sunbeam is on the far side of Andromeda but promises to take Ryley home, telling him that they will pick him up upon landing on a location Mountain Island. As the Sunbeam flies down, a giant alien facility fires upon it and it explodes in mid-air as Ryley watches. If the player manages to disable the facility before the Sunbeam lands, Quinn tells Ryley they are unable to land due to a debris field and will instead inform Alterra Corporation of the situation.\n","\n","Ryley finds records of the Degasi's crew stating that only three survived the initial crash, but later two out of the three are confirmed dead and one is presumed dead. Ryley also learns of the existence of the 'Precursors', an ancient, advanced alien species that came to planet 4546B approximately one thousand years ago in search of a cure for a highly infectious disease, known as the Kharaa Bacterium. The Precursors discovered Kharaa during the exploration of an unknown planet, and the disease spread due to a failure in quarantine procedures, killing over 140 billion individuals. Investigating thousands of planets in an attempt to find a cure, the Precursors eventually located a species of organism on 4546B they named the Sea Emperor Leviathan, which produced an enzyme that could cure Kharaa. However, the only living Sea Emperor was too old to produce the enzyme in enough potency to have any effect, and the Precursors were unable to force its only eggs to hatch. In an attempt to investigate the egg-hatching process of the Sea Emperor, the Precursors took the egg of a related Leviathan, the fire-breathing Sea Dragon, but the mother destroyed a Precursor research facility and released samples of Kharaa into the planet's ecosystem. Forced to evacuate, the Precursors enabled a facility known as the Quarantine Enforcement Platform, which consists of a large weapon that fires on any ships attempting to leave or land on the planet — including the Degasi, Aurora and Sunbeam.\n","\n","The Sea Emperor, which seeks the freedom of her children, communicates telepathically with Ryley and helps him discover the prison in which she is held captive. She gives Ryley information on how to hatch her eggs, who does so and is cured by the enzyme produced by the juvenile Sea Emperors. Ryley then disables the Quarantine Enforcement Platform (only achievable by one not infected with Kharaa) and constructs a rocket with blueprints transmitted by Alterra Corporation to the crashed Aurora. After escaping the planet, the Sea Emperor communicates with Ryley a final time, promising that the two \"go together\" although they are different.\n","\n","\n","Gameplay[edit]\n","\n","Subnautica: Below Zero is a survival adventure game set in an open world environment and played from a first-person perspective. Like its predecessor, the player's goal is to explore the environments and survive in an alien environment while also completing objectives to advance the game's plot. Players collect resources, construct tools, build bases and submersibles, and can interact with the planet's wildlife.[1]\n","\n","To survive and complete objectives, player must collect raw materials from the environment and craft equipment, vehicles, shelters, and food. Each of these has its own recipe, and some ingredients can only be found in the far-flung and deeper corners of the game world. Habitat structures provide shelter, storage for equipment and collected materials, and crafting stations. Inside a habitat, the player can also craft living amenities such as beds or coffee tables, although these are purely cosmetic since the game does not track fatigue.\n","\n","Each piece of equipment that can be crafted has its own recipe and the player begins the game knowing only a handful of recipes. The player learns new recipes by scanning scraps of technology or recovering databoxes, which are strewn across the game world. Alongside raw materials, finding new crafting recipes is a major reason to explore.\n","\n","Generally, the game requires the player to visit ever-deeper sections of the game in order to find exotic materials, technology to scan, and complete objectives. In fact, the final objective of the game is located at the deepest point in the game world. The main issue with accessing deep sections of the water is oxygen capacity. At the start of the game, the player character can only hold her breath for 45 seconds and even less at depths below 100 m. The player must craft equipment that will allow them to stay underwater for longer, such as high-capacity oxygen tanks and vehicles. Habitats and vehicles provide oxygen while powered, but vehicles need to be upgraded in order to withstand the water pressure at greater depths.\n","\n","The game primarily takes place underwater, but, unlike its predecessor, there are also expansive land-based areas to explore. There are explorable structures to find both above ground and underwater, which serve as key locations for the story, as well as sources of new blueprints used in crafting. In addition to the day-night cycle, there are dynamic weather effects, such as wind and fog, which further affect visibility. The game introduces new gadgets like the Headlamp, Mineral Detector, and Booster Tank.[2]\n","\n","Alongside returning mechanics such as oxygen, hunger, and thirst, players now have a body heat gauge which comes into play when walking on land. It functions much like the oxygen gauge does underwater. The player will gradually lose body heat and eventually die of hypothermia, unless they can replenish their body heat by jumping into water, consuming certain items or standing next to a heat source.\n","\n","Upon beginning a new game, players must select a difficulty mode from the following four:\n","\n","Plot[edit]\n","\n","Two years after the events of the original game, scientist Robin Ayou smuggles herself onto planet 4546B in a frozen biome named \"Sector Zero\" in order to investigate the circumstances of her sister Samantha's death, which Alterra claims was a result of \"employee negligence\". During the past year, Alterra had built a number of research bases on the planet but had recently withdrawn all of its personnel, giving Robin an opportunity to land on the planet.\n","\n","Shortly after landing, Robin picks up a distress signal and goes to investigate it, discovering an alien sanctuary containing the digitized consciousness of a living precursor. The alien introduces itself as Al-An and forcibly downloads itself into Robin's brain just as the sanctuary's power runs out. Angry at Al-An for intruding into her mind, Robin agrees to help it construct a new body for it to transfer into. In order to carry this out, Robin combs the planet for alien installations and artifacts to find the necessary components and materials. Al-An also explains that it did not try to contact Alterra because it believed Alterra's motivations did not align with its own, and it did not want to risk them finding a way to its homeworld. During their search, Al-An admits that it was one of the lead scientists researching a cure for the Kharaa bacterium and it disobeyed orders by trying to hatch Sea Dragon eggs, leading to the initial outbreak of Kharaa on 4546B.\n","\n","Meanwhile, Robin also continues her investigation into Samantha's death. She searches all of the abandoned Alterra research facilities, and finds out that Alterra discovered the corpse of a leviathan frozen in ice that was still infected by Kharaa. However, instead of destroying the Kharaa, Alterra decided to start researching the bacterium for useful applications. Fearing another outbreak and concerned Alterra will use Kharaa to develop bioweapons, Samantha decided to sabotage the project by using explosives to collapse the cave holding the leviathan, while her friend, Degasi survivor Marguerit Maida, destroyed the lab holding Alterra's Kharaa samples. However, Samantha was inadvertently caught in the blast and killed by falling rubble. Unable to determine the cause of the cave in, Alterra wrote off Samantha's death as a result of negligence. In order to prevent Alterra returning to the planet to restart their research, Robin recovers a cache of antibacterial agent Samantha had made earlier and uses it to neutralize the Kharaa infecting the frozen leviathan.\n","\n","Eventually, Robin is able to recover all of the components necessary to build a new body and fabricates it. Al-An transfers itself to the new body and decides to return to the precursor homeworld in order to see for itself what had happened to the other Architects, as well as to atone for its past mistakes. Al-An activates an Architect phase gate and Robin travels with Al-An to the precursor homeworld, uncertain of what they will find there.\n","\n","\n","Gameplay[edit]\n","\n","Subsurface Circular is a loose take on text-based adventure games, with the game presented in a three-dimensional, third-person perspective.[1] The player controls a robot detective in a futuristic setting, tasked with solving cases aboard a subway system below a human city that ferries around other robots that serve as the workforce. In the game, the robot detective must solve a case of a number of robots that have gone missing, by talking to other robots while they are on the subway cars, following various conversation trees, and at times, solving puzzles to help out a robot and get more information. The player acquires \"focal points\" on achieving certain goals, which then can be used to question other robots to get more information to solve the mystery.[2]\n","\n","Plot[edit]\n","\n","While the player can select from several names for the playable character, this summary assumes the use of \"Theta One One\" for purposes of clarity.\n","\n","Theta One One, the playable character, is an android-like Tek, assigned as a detective for other Teks on a subway system and serving his human masters, known as \"management\". During one night, one Tek, a fabricator, tells Theta One One of another Tek that had gone missing, and Theta One One decides to take the case. As the subway train circles the city, Theta One One talks to other Tek passengers, learning of a mysterious Red Tek that may be connected to the mystery, that a number of other Teks may have gone missing, and that there is growing resentment to Teks by the human population in the city above. Eventually, Theta One One is able to upload the case details to management, upon which they inform the Tek that since it took the case without their instructions, the Tek will be apprehended. At the next station, two detective Teks arrive, preparing to deal with Theta One One, but the Tek is able to manipulate the pair to learn that over hundreds of Teks have gone missing over the last several months, and to management, they saw this as a rounding error in Tek production. Management did not want this known, and thus it seems to others that Teks have simply gone missing. The detective Teks use an override access code to reset Theta One One to an unassigned position and leave the Tek to get off later on the subway ride to take itself to fabrication and be reassigned.\n","\n","Theta One One is still experiencing the sense of loss when at the next stop it meets an infantry Tek who seeks to confess its sins. Theta One One manages to coax this out of the Tek, and learns that it was part of the plan to overproduce infantry Teks that have been amassing outside of the city above, preparing to attack it; this is the source of management's rounding error. At the next stop, the same fabricator that Theta One One first talked to that night comes aboard, and reveals it was the Red Tek others spoke of, and is leading this plan. It planned to use the infantry Teks to kill management and have Teks take over which could run the city more efficiently; this would help the humans working low-level jobs to be able to pursue more constructive options while Teks replace their roles. Otherwise, without this change, the system will continue on the status quo, with management using Teks to replace humans, and hurting many humans in the process. Red Tek needed Theta One One to investigate as it did as to scout the current situation in the city from the Tek's perspective, providing its high-level intelligence to analyze the situation. At this point, Red Tek offers Theta One One a weapon and tells it that a choice to kill Red Tek or itself must be made; by killing Red Tek, Theta One One will be able to report to management about the infantry Teks and give them time to stop it, as to let the status quo remain; by killing itself, Theta One One would allow the Tek overthrow to proceed. The game ends after the player makes either choice.\n","\n","\n","None"]},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["IOPub data rate exceeded.\n","The notebook server will temporarily stop sending output\n","to the client in order to avoid crashing it.\n","To change this limit, set the config variable\n","`--NotebookApp.iopub_data_rate_limit`.\n","\n","Current values:\n","NotebookApp.iopub_data_rate_limit=1000000.0 (bytes/sec)\n","NotebookApp.rate_limit_window=3.0 (secs)\n","\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import re\n","\n","def clean_game_plots(game_plots):\n","    \"\"\"\n","    Clean the game plots by removing text within square brackets,\n","    replacing line breaks with spaces, and removing common prefix phrases.\n","    \"\"\"\n","    cleaned_plots = []\n","    prefixes = ['Gameplay ', 'Game-play ', 'Plot ']\n","    for content in game_plots:\n","        if content is not None:\n","            # Remove text within square brackets\n","            content = re.sub(r'\\[.*?\\]+', '', content)\n","            # Replace line breaks with space\n","            content = content.replace('\\n', ' ')\n","            # Remove common prefix phrases\n","            for prefix in prefixes:\n","                content = content.replace(prefix, '')\n","            cleaned_plots.append(content)\n","        else:\n","            cleaned_plots.append(None)\n","    return cleaned_plots\n","\n","game_df['Plots'] = clean_game_plots(game_df['Plots'])\n","game_df"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":624},"id":"z536TYaTufGW","outputId":"0e497133-8c4a-44d5-a0a5-6f0b1f78e7f8","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1681297584494,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":213,"user":{"displayName":"Pranjal Verma","userId":"06267253487679716986"}}},"execution_count":15,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["                                  Title  \\\n","0                            1-2-Switch   \n","1                     10 Second Ninja X   \n","2                13 Sentinels Aegis Rim   \n","3                                   140   \n","4          1979 Revolution Black Friday   \n","...                                 ...   \n","1908                Zombie Army Trilogy   \n","1909     Zombie Driver Immortal Edition   \n","1910  Zombieland Double Tap – Road Trip   \n","1911           Zombies Ate My Neighbors   \n","1912                  Zumba Burn it Up!   \n","\n","                                                 Link               Genre  \\\n","0                                    /wiki/1-2-Switch               Party   \n","1                             /wiki/10_Second_Ninja_X   Action platformer   \n","2                        /wiki/13_Sentinels_Aegis_Rim           Adventure   \n","3                              /wiki/140_(video_game)              Action   \n","4                  /wiki/1979_Revolution_Black_Friday           Adventure   \n","...                                               ...                 ...   \n","1908                        /wiki/Zombie_Army_Trilogy    Tactical shooter   \n","1909             /wiki/Zombie_Driver_Immortal_Edition    Vehicular combat   \n","1910  /wiki/Zombieland_Double_Tap_%E2%80%93_Road_Trip  Twin-stick shooter   \n","1911                   /wiki/Zombies_Ate_My_Neighbors         Run and gun   \n","1912                          /wiki/Zumba_Burn_it_Up!
